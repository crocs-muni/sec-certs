                		certificates and download all of the available PDFs: certificates, certification reports and security targets.
                		We run a caching proxy to minimize the load on the CC portal and disperse it over time by keeping the cache hot.

                		sites for a list of certified products, though not all publish this list properly. For some, we also scrape a list
                		of products in evaluation.
