1.2 PP Overview
Biometric systems that work based on fingerprints are often subject to a well known and easy kind of
attack: Attackers can use faked fingerprints (e.g. built out of gummy or silicone) that carry the
characteristics of a known user in order to get recognized by a biometric system. As an alternative a
user of a biometric system may use a faked finger in order to disguise their identity. Countermeasures
against those attacks may be implemented by a set of dedicated hardware and software, the so called
biometric spoof detection system.
In order to facilitate new mechanisms for spoof detection in fingerprint recognition systems and
thereby advancing innovative technologies in the area of security the project “LifeFinger I” has been
initiated by the Federal Office for Information Security. This Protection Profile forms part of this
project that has been conducted by the Bundesdruckerei GmbH.
The scope of this Protection Profile is to describe the functionality of a biometric spoof detection
system in terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for the evaluation of such
systems. Chapter 2 gives a more detailed overview about the design of the TOE and its boundaries.
This Protection Profile thereby focuses on application cases for which it is sufficient to determine
whether the security functionality claimed by a TOE is working correctly without performing a
dedicated vulnerability assessment. Therefore, this PP is solely based on organizational security
policies and threats are completely omitted. The explicit assurance package for an evaluation without a
vulnerability assessment is defined in chapter 3.4.
When planning an evaluation according to this PP the ST author should also consider the Fingerprint
Spoof Detection Protection Profile [FSDPP] which is based on threats and not organizational security
policies only. In general, the use of the [FSDPP] should be the preferred option.

2. TOE Description
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) described in this PP is a system that provides fingerprint spoof
detection either as part of, or in front of a biometric system for fingerprint recognition.
The TOE determines whether a fingerprint presented to the biometric system is genuine or spoofed.
The term spoofed biometric characteristics hereby refers to artificially created fake fingers which are
currently known to circumvent fingerprint recognition systems.
For this purpose the spoof detection system acquires spoofing evidences for a presented fingerprint
using a sensor device. This sensor can either be part of the capture device that is used to capture the
biometric sample of the fingerprint (or even be identical to it) or be a separate sensor device (or more
than one) that is completely dedicated to spoof detection.
Beside the fingerprint spoof detection functionality every TOE that claims conformance to this PP
shall implement:
• Management functionality to modify security relevant parameters
• Quality control for management parameters
• Audit functionality for security relevant events
• Protection of residual and security relevant data.
2.1 Protection of biometric systems
Systems claiming compliance to this Protection Profile are developed to protect biometric systems for
fingerprint recognition against one specific kind of attacks: The use of well known faked
finger(prints). The following paragraphs introduce the core biometric processes of a biometric system
in order to improve the understanding of the direct environment of the TOE and to explain the
motivation of an attacker.
● Enrollment:
Often, the enrollment process is the first contact of a user with a biometric system. This
process is necessary because a biometric system has to be trained in order to verify the identity
of each user based on their fingerprint.
During the enrollment process the system captures the fingerprint image of a user and extracts
the features it is working with. These features are then combined with the identity of the user
to a biometric reference and stored as template in a database.
During enrollment an attacker could try to present faked finger(prints) to the capture device in
order to get enrolled with another biometric characteristic. When having success the attackers
identity would be associated with the fake fingerprint. The important thing to notice in this
context is that an attacker must not necessarily have to have any knowledge about the
biometric characteristic of another user to perform this attack.
● Biometric verification:
The objective of a verification process is to verify or refuse the claimed identity of a user
based on their fingerprint. Therefore the user has to claim an identity to the system. The
system retrieves the fingerprint reference record associated with this identity from the
database and captures the live fingerprint. If the fingerprint features that are extracted from the
live fingerprint image and the fingerprint reference from the database are similar enough, the
claimed identity of the user is considered to be verified.
During biometric verification an attacker could try to use a faked finger to get recognized by
the system as another user (this kind of attack is often referred to as impersonation). For such
an attack however, the attacker will have to know about the biometric characteristic of the
attacked user.
Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik 5
FSDPP_OSP
Another specific aspect for a spoof detection system that is used to protect a biometric
verification process is that a claimed identity is available.
● Biometric identification:
The objective of a biometric identification process is similar to a verification process.
However, in contrast to a verification process there is no claimed identity for the user. The
system directly captures the fingerprint of a user and compares it to all fingerprint references
in the database. If at least one reference is found to be similar enough according to the relevant
threshold settings, the system returns this as the found identity of the user.
In the identification scenario an attacker can have multiple aims:
○ An attacker could try to get identified as a specific enrolled user (i.e. using a fake finger of
that specific user). The reason for doing so may be that this attacked user has a specific
credential that the attacker is after.
○ An attacker could try to get identified as any enrolled user (i.e. using a faked fingerprint of
any enrolled user). This can be relevant for cases where all enrolled users for a system
have similar permissions.
○ An attacker who is enrolled in the system could try avoid identification (i.e. disguise their
identity) For such an attack the attacker may not need any knowledge about the biometric
characteristic of another user.
More information on how the environment contributes to the security problem addressed by the TOE
can be found in the Fingerprint Spoof Detection Evaluation Guidance [FSDEG].
2.2 TOE configuration and TOE environment
A biometric spoof detection system in general could be realized in two major configurations:
● An integrated solution: All relevant parts of the TOE are integrated into one physical unit.
● A distributed solution: Relevant parts of the TOE are implemented in physically separated
parts.
This PP describes a biometric spoof detection system for fingerprints as an integrated solution but
should be applicable to distributed solutions as well. However, if applied to a distributed TOE
additional aspects of security shall be considered by the author of the Security Target in form of:
1. Assumptions for the TOE environment
2. Requirements for additional functionality: e. g. encrypted transmission
It is known that environmental factors may influence the performance and therewith the protection
provided by a spoof detection system. Therefore the author of a Security Target claiming compliance
to this PP shall clearly identify the relevant environmental factors and their acceptable range for the
operation of the TOE. More information about influencing factors can be found in [FSDEG].
In general it should be noted that the TOE should not impact the functionality of the protected
biometric system (e.g. by a deterioration of image quality) beyond what is necessary for the desired
application. If a negative impact cannot be completely avoided this shall be clearly pointed out by the
ST author.
2.3 TOE boundary
A simplified model of a biometric spoof detection system and its boundaries is shown in Figure 1.The
following chapters provide more details about the physical and logical boundaries of the TOE.

Other attributes
The TOE defined in this PP is limited to the biometric spoof detection system. This system shall
decide whether a provided fingerprint is spoofed or genuine. The TOE shall comprise all parts of a
product (hardware and software) that contribute to this functionality or any of the additional
functionality outlined in chapter 2.3.2. In particular these are:
• the capture device for capturing of fingerprint images
• additional sensor devices for acquisition of spoofing evidences (if applicable)
• necessary software (if applicable)
The spoofing evidences for a fingerprint can either be captured by the same sensor device being also
used for the biometric system (capture process) or using separate sensor devices. If separate sensor
devices are used, it has to be ensured that the same fingerprint is used for both processes.
The biometric system that is protected by the TOE resides in the environment. It can be, e. g., a
biometric identification system, a biometric verification system, or an enrollment system as described
in chapter 2.1. This means that all aspects about the security of the biometric systems (e.g. questions
about the error rates of this system) are out of scope for the evaluation of the TOE.
The TOE shall be able to generate audit data. This audit data can be used for quality assurance or
statistics. However, functionality for storage, protection and review of audit records is assumed to be
provided by the environment of the TOE.
Further the TOE may rely on access control mechanisms of the environment for its own protection and
the restriction of access to management functions offered by the TOE (e.g. for adjustment of important
parameters). Also for the implementation of management functions the TOE may partly rely on
functions of the environment (i.e. in form of a file import that involves the Operating System).
2.3.2 Logical boundary
The logical boundaries of the TOE can be defined by the functionality that it provides:
● Spoof detection: the TOE detects whether a presented fingerprint is spoofed or genuine. It
shall perform appropriate actions in case of a spoofed and in case of a genuine biometric
Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik 7
FSDPP_OSP
characteristic. It should be clearly mentioned that in the context of this PP a TOE is always
required to decide about the presented fingerprint in form of a yes/no decision. It is not
considered to be sufficient if a TOE would return a confidence value that would need further
interpretation by the environment.
● Management: the TOE provides functionality to manage its relevant parameters. This
specifically (but not only) refers to the parameters that are involved in the spoof detection
process (e.g. a threshold). The TOE ensures that only secure values for spoof detection
parameters are accepted to ensure the constant operation of the primary functionality.
● Residual Information Protection: in order to prevent the leakage of information the TOE
deletes relevant information if not longer in use.
● Audit: the TOE produces audit events for security relevant events.
The following functionality on the other hand may be provided by the environment to support the
operation of the TOE:
● Access control: the environment provides access control for the spoof detection parameters,
the life record, audit data and any software parts of the TOE. To perform access control, the
environment maintains roles for users and ensures their identification and authentication.
● Transmission / Storage: the environment provides a secure communication and storage for
data where security relevant data is transferred to or from the TOE.
● Auditing: the environment may provide additional audit functionality. In any case it will
provide reliable time stamps for auditing, storage for the audit records that are produced by the
TOE and mechanisms for review of audit logs. The developer will probably have to consider
privacy concerns (in case that personal information is part of the audit logs). Applicable data
protection laws and protection mechanisms might have to be considered.
●
Application Note:
To allow the application of this PP to a wide range of systems, several
functions are stated to be implemented in the environment. However, if a TOE
is able to provide those functions on its own the ST author should consider to
define those functions as part of the TOE.

3. Conformance Claims
3.1 Conformance statement
The PP requires strict conformance of any PPs/STs to this PP. A demonstrable conformance is not
allowed.
3.2 CC Conformance Claims
• This PP has been developed using Version 3.1 R3 of Common Criteria [CC].
• The conformance of this Protection Profile is Common Criteria [CC] Part II extended (due
to the use of FPT_SPOD.1)
• The conformance of this Protection Profile is Common Criteria [CC] Part III conformant.
3.3 PP Claim
• This PP does not claim conformance to any other Protection Profile.
3.4 Package Claim
This PP does not claim conformance to any assurance package (i.e. EAL) as defined in Common
Criteria Part III. Instead, this PP defines an explicit assurance package that bases on EAL 2. However,
in contrast to EAL 2 as defined in part III of [CC], the assurance package in this PP does not contain
any AVA_VAN component. It further includes the assurance component ALC_FLR.1.
The reason for this explicit assurance level is to allow a purely functional evaluation of the
performance of a system for spoof detection. Such an evaluation will allow to determine whether the
functionality of a system for spoof detection is sufficient to recognize spoofed biometric
characteristics that are know for a certain biometric modality.
An evaluation using this explicit assurance level is deliberately ignoring the fact that an attacker could
try to circumvent the functionality of the TOE (e.g. by using different/innovative spoofed
characteristics) and focuses on the basic functionality of the TOE. A system claiming compliance to
this Protection Profile is therefore suitable for the use in application cases in which an assurance about
the basic functionality of a system is sufficient. To emphasize that this PP only deals with the pure
functionality of spoof detection, the definition of threats has been omitted and the PP is completely
based on organizational security policies.
The complete list of the assurance components of the explicit assurance package can be found in
chapter 7.2.

4. Security Problem Definition
4.1 External entities
The following external entities interact with the TOE:
TOE administrator: The TOE administrator is authorized to perform administrative TOE
operations and able to use the administrative functions of the TOE.
The administrator is also responsible for the installation and maintenance of
the TOE.
Depending on the concrete implementation of a TOE there may be more than
one administrator and consequently also more than one administrative role.
User: A person who uses a biometric system that is protected by the TOE to get
enrolled, identified or verified and is therefore checked by the biometric spoof
detection system.
4.2 Assets
The following assets are defined in the context of this Protection Profile.
Primary assets: The primary assets do not belong to the TOE itself. The primary scope of the
biometric spoof detection system is the protection of the biometric system
behind it. As such any asset that is protected by the biometric system can be
considered being a primary asset for the TOE.
Formally, the decision that is taken by the TOE (fake/no fake) can be
considered being the primary asset.
Secondary assets: Secondary assets (i.e. TSF data) are information which are used by the TOE to
provide its core services and which consequently will need to be protected. The
following assets should be explicitly mentioned for the TOE:
● Spoof detection parameters (SDP): These (configuration) data
include the settings necessary to detect a spoofed biometric
characteristic, e. g., temperature limits, general threshold settings,
typical movement patterns. These parameters may be specific for a
claimed identity. The parameters are partly produced during
development of the TOE but may be adjusted during installation,
maintenance and enrollment. The integrity and confidentiality of these
parameters will have to be protected.
● Spoofing evidence (SE): This data is acquired by the capture device
and/or separated dedicated sensor devices for the purpose of spoof
detection. The TOE decides about a finger being a fake or not based on
this data. The integrity and confidentiality of this data have to be
protected.
● Audit data (AD): This data comprises the audit information that is
generated by the TOE. The integrity, confidentiality and authenticity of
the information has to be protected.

4.3 Assumptions
A.BIO The spoof detection system addressed in this Protection Profile is a protection
mechanism against spoofing attacks.
The biometric system that is protected by the TOE therefore ensures that all
threats that are not related to spoof detection are appropriately handled.
Further, the biometric system ensures that the functionality of the TOE is
invoked/used in order to protected the biometric system against spoof attacks.
It is also assumed that the fingerprint sample that is acquired by the capture
devices belongs to the fingerprint that is used for spoof detection.
4.4 Threats
No threats have been defined in the Security Problem Definition of this PP as it is solely based on
organizational security policies.
4.5 Organizational Security Policies
OSP.SPOOF_DETECTION The TOE shall be able to detect whether a presented fingerprint is
spoofed or genuine. The spoof detection shall be adequate to detect
all artificial biometric characteristics listed and described in
[Toolbox].
OSP.RESIDUAL The TOE shall ensure that no residual or unprotected security
relevant data remain in memory after operations are completed.
OSP.MANAGEMENT The TOE shall provide the necessary management functionality
for the modification of security relevant parameters for TOE
administrators. Only secure values shall be used for such
parameters.
OSP.AUDIT In order to
● generate statistics that can be used to adjust the parameters
for better quality (maintenance),
● trace modification, and
● trace possible attacks,
the TOE shall record security-relevant events.

5. Security Objectives
5.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
O.SPOOF_DETECTION The TOE shall be able to detect whether a presented fingerprint is
spoofed or genuine.
The spoofing evidence may be extracted from the data provided by the
same sensor that is used to acquire the biometric characteristic for
recognition (by the biometric system in the environment), or it may be
retrieved using sensors which are solely dedicated to spoof detection.
O.AUDIT The TOE shall produce audit records at least for the following security
relevant events:
● A use of the TOE where a faked fingerprint has been detected
● A use of the TOE where a genuine fingerprint has been
detected
● Every use of a management function
● All parameters modified by the management functions
O.RESIDUAL The TOE shall ensure that no residual or unprotected security relevant
data remain in memory after operations are completed.
O.MANAGEMENT The TOE shall provide the necessary management functionality for the
modification of security relevant parameters to TOE administrators
only.
As part of this management functionality the TOE shall only accept
secure values for security relevant parameters to ensure the correct
operation of the TOE.
5.2 Security objectives for the operational environment
OE.ADMINISTRATION The TOE administrator is well trained and non hostile. They read the
guidance documentation carefully, completely understands and
applies it.
The TOE administrator is responsible for the secure installation and
maintenance of the TOE and its platform and oversees the biometric
spoof detection system requirements. In particular, the administrator
shall ensure that all environmental factors (e. g., lighting,
electromagnetic fields) are within an acceptable range with respect to
the used capture and sensor devices.
The administrator assures that audit records of the TOE are regularly
reviewed in order to detect and prevent attacks being performed
against the TOE.
OE.PHYSICAL It shall be ensured that the TOE and its components are physically
protected against unauthorized access or modification. Physical
access to the hardware that is used by the TOE is only allowed for
authorized administrators.
This does not have to cover the capture device that has to be
accessible for every user.
12 Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik
FSDPP_OSP
OE.PLATFORM The platform the TOE runs on shall provide the TOE with services
necessary for its correct operation. Specifically the platform shall
• identify and authenticate TOE administrators,
• restrict to use the management functions of the TOE in order
to query, modify, delete, and clear security parameters which
are important for the operation of the TOE to TOE
administrators,
• provide access control for all secondary assets (spoof
detection parameters, spoofing evidence, and audit data) and
the software parts of the TOE,
• provide a secure communication and storage of information
where security relevant data is transferred to or from the
TOE,
• provide functionality for storage and review of audit
information and ensure that only authorized administrators
have access to the audit logs,
• provide reliable time stamps that can be used by the TOE,
and
• be free of malware like viruses, trojan horses, and other
malicious software.
OE.BIO The spoof detection system described in this Protection Profile is a
protection mechanism which ensures that spoofed fingerprints are
rejected by the TOE. The TOE only addresses the detection of spoof
attacks.
The biometric system that is protected by the TOE shall therefore
ensure that all threats that are not related to spoof detection are
appropriately handled.
Further, the biometric system shall ensure that the functionality of the
TOE is invoked/used in order to protected the biometric system
against spoof attacks.
5.3 Security Objectives rationale
5.3.1 Overview
The following table gives an overview of how the assumptions, threats, and organizational security
policies are addressed by the security objectives of the TOE. The text of the following sections
justifies this in more detail. Aspects of the TOE operational environment are marked grey.

Table 1: Security Objectives Rationale
5.3.2 Justification for coverage of assumptions
The only assumption A.BIO is covered by security objective OE.BIO as directly follows.
5.3.3 Justification for the coverage of organizational security policies
5.3.3.1 OSP.SPOOF_DETECTION
The organisational security policy OSP.SPOOF_DETECTION is covered by the security objective
O.SPOOF_DETECTION which is supported by O.MANAGEMENT, OE.ADMINISTRATION,
OE.PHYSICAL, and OE.PLATFORM..
O.SPOOF_DETECTION detects whether a presented fingerprint is spoofed or genuine, and
performs appropriate actions in case of a spoofed and in case of a genuine fingerprint. Therefore, a
spoofed fingerprint will not be used by the Biometric System being behind the TOE. This objective
covers the main part of the OSP.
O.MANAGEMENT provides necessary management functionality for the modification of security
relevant parameters to TOE administrators which are authenticated and authorized by the TOE
platform as stated in OE.PLATFORM. TOE administrators are well-trained and non-hostile
according to OE.ADMINISTRATION and will therefore unlikely misconfigure the spoof detection
functionality. All three objectives ensure that the spoof detection is securely managed and therefore
support that spoof detection performs as intended.
OE.PHYSICAL ensures that the TOE is physically protected against manipulation so that the spoof
detection functionality can not be compromised using physically means.
OE.PLATFORM further ensures that the platform for the TOE provides secure communication and
storage of data and ensures that the TOE is free of malware which could otherwise compromise the
spoof detection.
OE.ADMINISTRATION further ensures that environmental factors which influence the capture and
sensor devices are within acceptable ranges. It therefore supports that the spoof detection functionality
is not compromised by environmental conditions.
14 Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik
FSDPP_OSP
5.3.3.2 OSP.MANAGEMENT
OSP.MANAGEMENT is covered by the security objectives O.MANAGEMENT which is supported
by OE.ADMINISTRATION, OE.PHYSICAL, and OE.PLATFORM..
O.MANAGEMENT provides the necessary management functionality to securely modify security
parameters. It comprises the main part to cover the OSP. It is supported by OE.PLATFORM which
ensures that only authenticated TOE administrators are authorized to manage the TOE.
OE.ADMINISTRATION thereby ensures that these TOE administrators are well-trained and non-
hostile so that misconfiguration is unlikely.
OE.PHYSICAL ensures that the TOE is physically protected against manipulation so that
management functionality can not be altered by physically means.
OE.PLATFORM further ensures that the platform for the TOE provides secure communication and
storage of data and ensures that the TOE is free of malware which could otherwise compromise the
management functionality.
5.3.3.3 OSP.RESIDUAL
OSP.RESIDUAL is covered by security objective O.RESIDUAL which is supported by
OE.ADMINISTRATION, OE.PHYSICAL, and OE.PLATFORM..
O.RESIDUAL ensures that no residual or unprotected security relevant data remains after operations
are completed and therefore residual security relevant data from a previous usage of the TOE can not
be used by an attacker. It comprises the main part to cover the OSP. It is supported by
OE.PHYSICAL which ensures that the TOE is physically protected against manipulation and
therefore residual information can not be obtained via physical attacks.
OE.PLATFORM ensures that the TOE platform is free of malware and therefore does not
compromise functionality for residual information protection. OE.ADMINISTRATION supports that
as it ensures that the platform is securely installed by the TOE administrator.
5.3.3.4 OSP.AUDIT
The organizational security policy OSP.AUDIT is covered by O.AUDIT which is supported by
OE.PLATFORM..
O.AUDIT ensures that the TOE generates audit records for security relevant events and therefore
comprises the main part to cover the OSP.
OE.PLATFROM ensures that the environment provides the time stamps necessary for audit, the
secure storage for audit data, and mechanisms for review of audit data. It therefore supports the task of
O.AUDIT.

6. Extended Component definition

of the TSF) has been defined here to describe the core security function as provided by the TOE
described in this PP: The TOE shall prevent that a spoofed biometric characteristics can be used with a
biometric system that is protected by the TOE. The class FPT (Protection of the TSF) as defined in
part II of Common Criteria has been selected even if the functionality to be protected is not part of the
TOE. The following chapter contains the detailed definition.

6.1.2 Justification for the definition of functional family FPT_SPOD
Spoof detection functionality describes mechanisms that protect biometric systems like fingerprint
verification systems against threats of non-genuine biometric characteristics like fake fingers. It
therefore provides protection of the TSF which is subject of the functional class FPT.
There is no family in FPT that deals with detection of spoofing attacks or biometric functionality at all,
therefore a new family has been defined.

7. Security Requirements
This chapter describes the security functional and the assurance requirements which have to be
fulfilled by the TOE.
Those requirements comprise functional components from part II of [CC] and assurance components
from part III of [CC]. Further the extended requirement FPT_SPOD.1 as defined in chapter 6 is used.
The following notations are used to mark operations that have been performed:
● Selection operations (used to select one or more options provided by the [CC] in stating a
requirement.) are denoted by underlined text
● Assignment operation (used to assign a specific value to an unspecified parameter, such as the
length of a password) are denoted by italicized text.
● No Refinements have been performed
● No Iterations have been performed.

7.1.1 Security audit (FAU)
7.1.1.1 Security audit data generation (FAU_GEN)
FAU_GEN.1 Audit data generation
FAU_GEN.1.1 The TSF shall be able to generate an audit record of the following auditable events:
a) Start-up and shutdown of the audit functions;
b) All auditable events for the [basic] level of audit; and
c) [modification of Spoof Detection Parameters, and
d) [assignment: other specifically defined auditable events]].
FAU_GEN.1.2 The TSF shall record within each audit record at least the following information:
a) Date and time of the event, type of event, subject identity (if applicable), and the
outcome (success or failure) of the event; and
b) For each audit event type, based on the auditable event definitions of the
functional components included in the PP/ST, [assignment: other audit relevant
information].
Hierarchical to: No other components
Dependencies: FPT_STM.1
Application Note: According to the chosen level of audit and the SFRs contained in this PP the
TOE has to audit the following event per minimum:
● A use of the TOE where a faked fingerprint has been detected
(FPT_SPOD.1)
● A use of the TOE where a genuine fingerprint has been detected
(FPT_SPOD.1)
● Every use of a management function (FMT_SMF.1)
● All parameters rejected by the management functions (FMT_SMF.3)
If useful in the context of a concrete technology the ST author should consider
to audit additional information (e.g. a score or a claimed identity) together with
the first two events.
7.1.2 User data protection (FDP)
7.1.2.1 Residual information protection (FDP_RIP)
FDP_RIP.2 Full residual information protection
FDP_RIP.2.1 The TSF shall ensure that any previous information content of a resource is made
unavailable upon the [deallocation of the resource from] all objects.
Hierarchical to: FDP_RIP.1
Dependencies: No dependencies

7.1.3 Security management (FMT)
7.1.3.1 Management of TSF data (FMT_MTD)
FMT_MTD.3 Secure TSF data
FMT_MTD.3.1 The TSF shall ensure that only secure values are accepted for [
● [assignment: list of all spoof detection parameters]
● [assignment: list of other TSF data or none]
]
Hierarchical to: No other components
Dependencies: FMT_MTD.1
Application Note: The assignment in FMT_MTD.3.1 (list of all spoof detection parameters)
represents the minimum of parameters for which the TOE has to ensure
secure settings. The objective O.MANAGEMENT however requires that the
TOE has to ensure secure values for all security relevant parameters.
As the list of those parameters depends on the concrete technology the ST
author shall add all security relevant parameters to this assignment.
7.1.3.2 Specification of Management Functions (FMT_SMF.1)
FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions
FMT_SMF.1.1 The TSF shall be capable of performing the following management
functions: [assignment: list of management functions to be provided by the
TSF].
Hierarchical to: No other components
Dependencies: No dependencies
Application Note: The necessary management functions are highly depending on the necessary
information for the core functionality as defined in FPT_SPOD.1. The ST
author shall consider all relevant parameters and decide whether a
management function will be necessary for each.

7.1.4 Protection of the TSF (FPT)
7.1.4.1 Biometric Spoof Detection (FPT_SPOD.1)
FPT_SPOD.1 Biometric Spoof Detection
FPT_SPOD.1.1 The TSF shall be able to detect whether a presented [fingerprint] is spoofed or
genuine.
FPT_SPOD.1.2 If a spoofed biometric characteristic is detected, the following action(s) shall be
performed:
● [assignment: list of actions]
FPT_SPOD.1.3 If a genuine biometric characteristic is detected, the following action(s) shall be
performed:
● [assignment: list of actions]
FPT_SPOD.1.4 Along with the feedback about spoof status of the presented biometric
characteristic the TOE shall deliver the following information:
● [assignment: list of information]
Hierarchical to: No other components
Dependencies: FMT_MTD.3 Secure TSF data
FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions
Application Note: FPT_SPOD.1 represents the core functionality to be provided by the TOE.
Due to the special character of this technology additional guidance for
evaluation is provided in form of [FSDEG]. This guidance shall be applied
during evaluation.
Application Note: Please note that any use of residual information that remains on a sensor
device is considered being a spoofed characteristic in the context of this
SFR.
Application Note: In FPT_SPOD.1.4, the ST author should list all additional information that
shall be delivered by the spoof detection functionality to the integrating
biometric system. Such information could be an additional score value that
represents the likelihood that the presented biometric characteristic is
spoofed. However, the ST author should understand that such information is
sensitive as an attacker could use it to improve his attacks. Such information
shall not be visible to the user of the biometric system.

7.3 Security Requirements rationale
7.3.1 Security Functional Requirements rationale
7.3.1.1 Fulfillment of the Security Objectives
This chapter proves that the set of security requirements (TOE) is suited to fulfill the security
objectives described in chapter 4 and that each SFR can be traced back to the security objectives. At
least one security objective exists for each security requirement.
O.AUDIT
O.
RESIDUAL
O.MANAGEMENT
O.SPOOF_DETECTION
FAU_GEN.1 X
FDP_RIP.2 X
FMT_MTD.3 X
FMT_SMF.1 X
FPT_SPOD.1 X
Table 4:Fulfillment of Security Objectives
The following paragraphs contain more details on this mapping.
O.AUDIT
● FAU_GEN.1 defines that the TOE has to capture all the events as required by O.AUDIT.
O.RESIDUAL
● This objective is completely covered by FDP_RIP.2 as directly follows.
O.MANAGEMENT
● FMT_MTD.1 defines that the TOE only accepts secure values for spoof detection parameters
so that the spoof detection works correctly.
● FMT_SMF.1 ensures that the TOE provides the necessary management functionality
O.SPOOF_DETECTION
● FPT_SPOD.1 defines that the TOE is able to detect whether a presented fingerprint is
spoofed or genuine and therewith directly addresses this objective.
7.3.1.2 Fulfillment of the dependencies
The following table summarizes all TOE functional requirements dependencies of this PP and
demonstrates that they are fulfilled.

Table 5: Security Functional Requirements
7.3.1.3 Justification for missing dependencies
The functional component FAU_GEN.1 has an identified dependency on FPT_STM.1. This
dependency is not satisfied by any TOE functional requirement as the functionality of reliable time
stamps is provided by the TOE environment (OE.PLATFORM).
The functional component FMT_MTD.3 has an identified dependency on FMT_MTD.1. This
dependency is not satisfied by any TOE functional requirement as the functionality of restricting the
ability to query, modify, delete, and clear security parameters to TOE administrators is provided by the
TOE environment (see OE.PLATFORM).
7.3.2 Security Assurance Requirements rationale
Due to the special character of the technology described in this PP, an explicit assurance package has
been defined for the TOE. It has been chosen for this Protection Profile as it should focus on
application cases for which it is sufficient to determine whether the security functionality claimed by a
TOE is working correctly without performing a dedicated vulnerability assessment.
The defined assurance package has been developed based on EAL 2. In contrast to EAL 2, it does not
contain AVA_VAN.2 but has been augmented by the assurance component ALC_FLR.1. ALC_FLR.1
has been included as spoof detection systems are supposed to have flaws that will be found in future
and that will then have to be addressed.
Additional guidance has been provided for some of the assurance components due to the special nature
of the biometric technology in form of [FSDEG].

Term Description
AD Audit data
Audit data Content of the audit trace generated by the TOE.
Attacker An attacker in the context of this PP is any individual who is attempting to
subvert the operation of the biometric system protected by the TOE using a
faked fingerprint.
This does explicitly included cases in which users try to subvert the operation
of the TOE directly but in any case it is the final focus of an attacker to
subvert the operation of the protected biometric system using a faked
fingerprint.
Biometric A measurable physical characteristic or personal behavioral trait used to
recognize the identity of a user or verify a claimed identity.
Biometric
identification
Application in which a search of the enrolled database is performed, and a
candidate list of 0, 1 or more identifiers is returned.
Biometric system An automated system capable of capturing a biometric sample from a user,
extracting biometric data from the sample, comparing the data with one or
more biometric references, deciding on how well they match, and indicating
whether or not an identification or verification of identity has been achieved.
Note that in [CC] evaluation terms, a biometric system may be a product or
part of a system.
Biometric verification The objective of a verification process is to verify or refuse the claimed
identity of a user based on their biometric characteristic.
