Certification Report

## Preliminary Remarks

Under the BSIG 1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security  (BSI) has the task of issuing certificates for information technology products as well as for Protection Profiles (PP).

A  PP   defines   an   implementation-independent   set   of   IT   security   requirements   for   a category of products which are intended to meet common consumer needs for IT security. The development and certification of a PP or the reference to an existent one gives consumers the possibility to express their IT security needs without referring to a special product. Product or system certifications can be based on Protection Profiles. For products which have been certified based on a Protection Profile an individual certificate will be issued.

Certification of the Protection Profile is carried out on the instigation of the BSI or a sponsor.

A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the Protection Profile according to Common Criteria [1].

The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by BSI itself.

The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report contains   among   others   the   certificate   (summarised   assessment)   and   the   detailed Certification Results.

## 1 Protection Profile Overview

The  Fingerprint   Spoof   Detection   Protection   Profile   based   on   Organisational   Security Policies (FSDPP_OSP), Version 1.7 [6] is established by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) as a basis for the development of Security Targets in order to perform a certification of an IT-product (TOE).

The Target of Evaluation (TOE) described in the Protection Profile (PP) is a system that provides fingerprint spoof detection either as part of or in front of a biometric system for fingerprint recognition.

The TOE determines whether a fingerprint presented to the biometric system is genuine or spoofed. The term spoofed biometric characteristics hereby refers to artificially created fake fingers which are currently known to circumvent fingerprint recognition systems.

For this purpose the spoof detection system acquires spoofing evidences for a presented fingerprint using a sensor device. This sensor can either be part of the capture device that is used to capture the biometric sample of the fingerprint (or even be identical to it) or be a separate sensor device (or more than one) that is completely dedicated to spoof detection.

Beside the fingerprint spoof detection functionality every TOE that claims conformance to the PP shall implement:

- Management functionality to modify security relevant parameters
- Quality control for management parameters
- Audit functionality for security relevant events
- Protection of residual and security relevant data

The assets to be protected by a TOE claiming conformance to this PP are defined in the Protection Profile [6], chapter 4.2. Based on these assets the Security Problem Definition is defined in terms of Assumptions and Organisational Security Policies. This is outlined in the Protection Profile [6], chapters 4.3 to 4.5.

These Assumptions and Organisational Security Policies are split into Security Objectives to be fulfilled by a TOE claiming conformance to this PP and Security Objectives to be fulfilled by the operational environment of a TOE claiming conformance to this PP. These Security Objectives are outlined in the PP [6], chapter 5.

The Protection Profile [6] requires a Security Target based on this PP or another PP claiming this PP, to fulfil the CC requirements for strict conformance.

## 2 Security Functional Requirements

Based on the Security Objectives to be fulfilled by a TOE claiming conformance to this PP the security policy is expressed by the set of Security Functional Requirements to be implemented by a TOE. It covers the following issues: Biometric spoof detection, security audit, residual information protection and TOE security management.

These TOE Security Functional Requirements (SFR) are outlined in the PP [6], chapter 7.1. They are selected from Common Criteria Part 2 and one of them is newly defined. Thus the SFR claim is called:

Common Criteria Part 2 extended

BSI-CC-PP-0062-2010

Certification Report

## 3 Security Assurance Requirements

Due to the special character of the technology described in this PP, an explicit assurance package has been defined for the TOE. It has been chosen for this Protection Profile as the PP should focus on application cases for which it is sufficient to determine whether the Security   Functionality   claimed   by   a   TOE   is   working   correctly   without   performing   a dedicated vulnerability assessment.

The TOE security assurance package claimed in the Protection Profile is based entirely on the assurance components defined in part 3 of the Common Criteria. Thus, this assurance package is called:

Common Criteria Part 3 conformant

This   explicit   assurance   package   is   based   on   EAL   2   and   consists   of   the   following Assurance Families:

ADV_ARC.1, ADV_FSP.2, ADV_TDS.1, AGD_OPE.1, AGD_PRE.1, ALC_CMC.2, ALC_CMS.2, ALC_DEL.1, ALC_FLR.1, ASE_CCL.1, ASE_ECD.1, ASE_INT.1, ASE_OBJ.2, ASE_REQ.2, ASE_SPD.1, ASE_TSS.1, ATE_COV.1, ATE_FUN.1, ATE_IND.2

(for the definition and scope of assurance packages according to CC see part C or [1], part 3 for details).

The  only   differences   compared   to   EAL   2   are   the   omitted   AVA_VAN.2   assurance component and the added ALC_FLR.1 assurance component.

Additional guidance in form of the Fingerprint Spoof Detection Evaluation Guidance [8] has been provided for some of the assurance components due to the special nature of the biometric technology.

## 4 Results of the PP-Evaluation

The Evaluation Technical Report (ETR) [5] was provided by the ITSEF according to the Common Criteria [1], the Methodology [2], the requirements of the Scheme [3] and all interpretations and guidelines of the Scheme (AIS) [7] as relevant for the TOE.

As a result of the evaluation the verdict PASS is confirmed for the assurance components of the class APE.

The following assurance components were used:

APE_INT.1 PP introduction

APE_CCL.1 Conformance claims

APE_SPD.1 Security problem definition

APE_OBJ.2 Security objectives

APE_ECD.1 Extended components definition

APE_REQ.2 Derived security requirements

The results of the evaluation are only applicable to the Protection Profile as defined in chapter 1.

## C Excerpts from the Criteria

## CC Part1:

Conformance Claim (chapter 10.4)

'The conformance claim indicates the source of the collection of requirements that is met by a PP or ST that passes its evaluation.  This   conformance   claim   contains   a   CC conformance claim that:

- describes the version of the CC to which the PP or ST claims conformance.
- describes the conformance to CC Part 2 (security functional requirements) as either:
- -CC Part 2 conformant - A PP or ST is CC Part 2 conformant if all SFRs in that PP or ST are based only upon functional components in CC Part 2, or
- -CC Part 2 extended - A PP or ST is CC Part 2 extended if at least one SFR in that PP or ST is not based upon functional components in CC Part 2.
- describes the conformance to CC Part 3 (security assurance requirements) as either:
- -CC Part 3 conformant - A PP or ST is CC Part 3 conformant if all SARs in that PP or ST are based only upon assurance components in CC Part 3, or
- -CC Part 3 extended - A PP or ST is CC Part 3 extended if at least one SAR in that PP or ST is not based upon assurance components in CC Part 3.

Additionally,   the   conformance   claim   may   include   a   statement   made   with   respect   to packages, in which case it consists of one of the following:

- Package name Conformant - A PP or ST is conformant to a pre-defined package (e.g. EAL) if:
- -the SFRs of that PP or ST are identical to the SFRs in the package, or
- -the SARs of that PP or ST are identical to the SARs in the package.
- Package name Augmented - A PP or ST is an augmentation of a predefined package if:
- -the SFRs of that PP or ST contain all SFRs in the package, but have at least one additional SFR or one SFR that is hierarchically higher than an SFR in the package.
- -the SARs of that PP or ST contain all SARs in the package, but have at least one additional SAR or one SAR that is hierarchically higher than an SAR in the package.

Note that when a TOE is successfully evaluated to a given ST, any conformance claims of the ST also hold for the TOE. A TOE can therefore also be e.g. CC Part 2 conformant. Finally, the conformance claim may also include two statements with respect to Protection

Profiles:

- PP Conformant - A PP or TOE meets specific PP(s), which are listed as part of the conformance result.
- Conformance Statement (Only for PPs) - This statement describes the manner in which PPs or STs must conform to this PP: strict or demonstrable. For more information on this Conformance Statement, see Annex D.

BSI-CC-PP-0062-2010

## CC Part 3:

## Class APE: Protection Profile evaluation (chapter 10)

## Evaluation assurance levels (chapter 8)

'The Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs) provide an increasing scale that balances the level   of   assurance   obtained   with   the   cost   and   feasibility   of   acquiring   that   degree   of assurance. The CC approach identifies the separate concepts of assurance in a TOE at the end of the evaluation, and of maintenance of that assurance during the operational use of the TOE.

It is important to note that not all families and components from CC Part 3 are included in the   EALs.   This   is   not   to   say   that   these   do   not   provide   meaningful   and   desirable assurances. Instead, it is expected that these families and components will be considered for augmentation of an EAL in those PPs and STs for which they provide utility.'

## Evaluation assurance level (EAL) overview (chapter 8.1)

'Table 1 represents a summary of the EALs. The columns represent a hierarchically ordered set of EALs, while the rows represent assurance families. Each number in the resulting matrix identifies a specific assurance component where applicable.

As outlined in the next Section, seven hierarchically ordered evaluation assurance levels are defined in the CC for the rating of a TOE's assurance. They are hierarchically ordered inasmuch as each EAL represents more assurance than all lower EALs. The increase in assurance from EAL to EAL is accomplished by substitution of a hierarchically higher assurance component from the same assurance family (i.e. increasing rigour, scope, and/or depth) and from the addition of assurance components from other assurance families (i.e. adding new requirements).

These EALs consist of an appropriate combination of assurance components as described in chapter 7 of this CC Part 3. More precisely, each EAL includes no more than one component of each assurance family and all assurance dependencies of every component are addressed.

While the EALs are defined in the CC, it is possible to represent other combinations of assurance. Specifically, the notion of 'augmentation' allows the addition of assurance components (from assurance families not already included in the EAL) or the substitution of assurance components (with another hierarchically higher assurance component in the same assurance family) to an EAL. Of the assurance constructs defined in the CC, only EALs   may   be   augmented.   The   notion   of   an   'EAL   minus   a   constituent   assurance component' is not recognised by the standard as a valid claim. Augmentation carries with it the obligation on the part of the claimant to justify the utility and added value of the added assurance component to the EAL. An EAL may also be augmented with extended assurance requirements.

## Evaluation assurance level 1 (EAL1) - functionally tested (chapter 8.3)

## 'Objectives

EAL1 is applicable where some confidence in correct operation is required, but the threats to security are not viewed as serious. It will be of value where independent assurance is required to support the contention that due care has been exercised with respect to the protection of personal or similar information.

EAL1 requires only a limited security target. It is sufficient to simply state the SFRs that the TOE must meet, rather than deriving them from threats, OSPs and assumptions through security objectives.

EAL1 provides an evaluation of the TOE as made available to the customer, including independent   testing   against   a   specification,   and   an   examination   of   the   guidance documentation provided. It is intended that an EAL1 evaluation could be successfully conducted without assistance from the developer of the TOE, and for minimal outlay.

An evaluation at this level should provide evidence that the TOE functions in a manner consistent with its documentation.'

## Evaluation assurance level 2 (EAL2) - structurally tested (chapter 8.4)

## 'Objectives

EAL2 requires the co-operation of  the   developer   in   terms   of   the   delivery   of   design information   and   test   results,   but   should   not   demand   more   effort   on   the   part   of   the developer than is consistent with good commercial practise. As such it should not require a substantially increased investment of cost or time.

EAL2 is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a low   to   moderate   level   of   independently   assured   security   in   the   absence   of   ready availability of the complete development record. Such a situation may arise when securing legacy systems, or where access to the developer may be limited.'

## Evaluation assurance level 3 (EAL3) - methodically tested and checked (chapter 8.5)

## 'Objectives

EAL3 permits   a   conscientious   developer   to   gain   maximum   assurance   from   positive security engineering at the design stage without substantial alteration of existing sound development practises.

EAL3 is applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a moderate level of independently assured security, and require a thorough investigation of the TOE and its development without substantial re-engineering.'

## Evaluation assurance level 4 (EAL4) - methodically designed, tested, and reviewed (chapter 8.6)

## 'Objectives

EAL4 permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering based on good commercial development practises which, though rigorous, do not require substantial specialist knowledge, skills, and other resources. EAL4 is the highest level at which it is likely to be economically feasible to retrofit to an existing product line.

EAL4 is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a moderate to high level of independently assured security in conventional commodity TOEs and are prepared to incur additional security-specific engineering costs.'

## Evaluation assurance level 5 (EAL5) - semiformally designed and tested (chapter 8.7)

## 'Objectives

EAL5 permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development practises supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable   to   the   EAL5   requirements,   relative   to   rigorous   development   without   the application of specialised techniques, will not be large.

EAL5 is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a high level of independently assured security in a planned development and require a rigorous   development   approach   without   incurring   unreasonable   costs   attributable   to specialist security engineering techniques.'

## Evaluation   assurance   level   6   (EAL6)   -   semiformally   verified   design   and   tested (chapter 8.8)

## 'Objectives

EAL6 permits developers to gain high assurance from application of security engineering techniques to a rigorous development environment in order to produce a premium TOE for protecting high value assets against significant risks.

EAL6 is therefore applicable to the development of security TOEs for application in high risk situations where the value of the protected assets justifies the additional costs.'

## Evaluation   assurance   level   7   (EAL7)   -   formally   verified   design   and   tested (chapter 8.9)

## 'Objectives

EAL7 is applicable to the development of security TOEs for application in extremely high risk situations and/or where the high value of the assets justifies the higher costs. Practical application of EAL7 is currently limited to TOEs with tightly focused security functionality that is amenable to extensive formal analysis.'

## Class AVA: Vulnerability assessment (chapter 16)

'The   AVA:   Vulnerability   assessment   class   addresses   the   possibility   of   exploitable vulnerabilities introduced in the development or the operation of the TOE.'

## Vulnerability analysis (AVA_VAN) (chapter 16.1)

## "Objectives

Vulnerability   analysis   is   an   assessment   to   determine   whether   potential   vulnerabilities identified, during the evaluation of the development and anticipated operation of the TOE or by other methods (e.g. by flaw hypotheses or quantitative or statistical analysis of the security behaviour of the underlying security mechanisms), could allow attackers to violate the SFRs.

Vulnerability analysis deals with the threats that an attacker will be able to discover flaws that will allow unauthorised access to data and functionality, allow the ability to interfere with or alter the TSF, or interfere with the authorised capabilities of other users.'
