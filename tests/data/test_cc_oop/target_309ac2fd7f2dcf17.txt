Table 1 â€“ ST Organization and Section Descriptions
Document Conventions
The notation, formatting, and conventions used in this Security Target are consistent with those
used in Version 3.1 of the Common Criteria. Selected presentation choices are discussed here
to aid the Security Target reader. The Common Criteria allows several operations to be
performed on functional requirements: The allowable operations defined in Part 2 of the
Common Criteria are refinement, selection, assignment and iteration.
ï‚· The refinement operation is used to add detail to a requirement, and thus further
restricts a requirement. Refinement of security requirements is denoted by bold text.
Any text removed is indicated with a strikethrough format (Example: TSF).
ï‚· The selection operation is picking one or more items from a list in order to narrow the
scope of a component element. Selections are denoted by italicized text.
ï‚· The assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified parameter,
such as the length of a password. An assignment operation is indicated by showing the
value in square brackets, i.e. [assignment_value(s)].
ï‚· Iterated functional and assurance requirements are given unique identifiers by
appending to the base requirement identifier from the Common Criteria an iteration
number inside parenthesis, for example, FMT_MTD.1.1 (1) and FMT_MTD.1.1 (2) refer
to separate instances of the FMT_MTD.1 security functional requirement component.
When not embedded in a Security Functional Requirement, italicized text is used for both
official document titles and text meant to be emphasized more than plain text.

Administration Workstation (Console):
The Administration Workstation (Console) is used to access the Identity Applications (RBPM),
Identity Manager, and the Reporting Server. Each of these functions is described below.
Identity Applications (RBPM)
The Identity Applications (RBPM) houses the Designer / Analyzer functions. The Identity
Application is a Web application (browser-based) that gives users and business administrators
the ability to perform a variety of identity self-service and roles provisioning tasks, including
managing passwords and identity data, initiating and monitoring provisioning and role
assignment requests, managing the approval process for provisioning requests, and verifying

attestation reports. It includes the workflow engine that controls the routing of requests
through the appropriate approval process. Designer aka Designer for Identity Manager helps
you design, test, document, and deploy Identity Manager solutions in a network or test
environment. Analyzer aka NetIQ Analyzer for Identity Manager is an identity management
toolset that helps you ensure that internal data quality policies are adhered to by providing
data analysis, data cleansing, data reconciliation, and data monitoring/reporting. Analyzer lets
you analyze, enhance, and control all data stores throughout the enterprise.
Identity Manager:
The Identity Manager houses the Identity Manager Engine (and the Identity Vault which
contains the Identity Applications data) and iManager. The Identity Manager Engine
synchronizes identity data between applications. For example, data synchronized from a
PeopleSoft system to Lotus Notes is first added to the Identity Vault and then sent to the Lotus
Notes system. In addition, the Identity Vault stores information specific to Identity Manager,
such as driver configurations, parameters, and policies.
The following packages are used to provide cryptographic functions, and are not included in
the TOE boundary. NetIQ eDirectory is used for the Identity Vault. eDirectory provides access
to the OpenSSL Cryptographic functionality.
They meet the cryptographic quality requirements as evidenced by the following certificates:
Component CAVP Cert #
AES Certs. #3090 and #3264
HMAC Certs. #1937 and #2063
RSA Certs. #1581 and #1664
Table 3 â€“ CAVP Certificate Numbers
Reporting Server:
The reporting server houses the Identity Reporting Module. The Identity Reporting Module
generates reports that show critical business information about various aspects of your
Identity Manager configuration, including information collected from Identity Vaults and
managed systems such as Active Directory or SAP. The reporting module provides a set of
predefined report definitions you can use to generate reports. In addition, it gives you the
option to import custom reports defined in a third-party tool. The user interface for the
reporting module makes it easy to schedule reports to run at off-peak times to optimize
performance.
The IDM Tools are used to manage the Identity Manager solution. This includes functions to:
ï‚· Analyze, enhance, and control all data stores throughout the enterprise
ï‚· Design, deploy, and document the TOE
ï‚· Manage Identity Manager and receive real-time health and status information
about the Identity Manager system
ï‚· Define and maintain which authorizations are associated with which business roles
Log Manager:
The Log Manager, also known as Sentinel Log Manager for Identity Governance and
Administration (SLM for IGA), collects and acknowledges receipt of auditing data from all
aspects of the product.
OneSSO Provider:
June 1, 2020 NetIQ Identity Manager 4.7 ST
NetIQ Corporation Page 10 of 36
The OneSSO Provider, also known as OSP) is a single interface for access authentication. This
provider can handle user name / password, Kerberos, and SAML tokens.
Self Service Password Reset:
Self Service Password Reset (SSPR) allows users to enroll, update, and reset their passwords
without administrative intervention in the Identity Vault (IDV).
Note: that the components above can be installed on one or multiple distributed systems. Also,
the hardware, operating systems and third-party support software (e.g. DBMS) on each of the
systems are excluded from the TOE boundary.
TOE Delivery:
The TOE software is provided to customers via secure download from the download portal
(https://dl.netiq.com/index.jsp). The software is available as either a gnu zip (.gz), iso
formatted optical disk (.iso). zip (.zip) or dmg (if mac) depending on your destination platform.

NetIQ Corporation Page 29 of 36
OBJECTIVE RATIONALE
O.MANAGE_DATA The objective to ensure that the TOE will collect events from security
products and non-security products deployed within a network and
applies analytical processes to derive conclusions about the events is
met by the following security requirements:
ï‚· FPT_TDC.1 ensures that the TOE provides consistency between
passwords used on remote IT systems and those
stored/managed within the TOE.
O.MANAGE_POLICY The objective to ensure that the TOE provides a workflow to manage
authentication and access control policies is met by the following
security requirements:
ï‚· FAU_GEN.1 and FAU_SAR.1 define the auditing capability for
incidents and administrative access control and requires that
authorized users will have the capability to read and interpret
data stored in the audit logs
ï‚· FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1 support the security functions
relevant to the TOE and ensure the definition of an authorized
administrator role
O.SEC_ACCESS This objective ensures that the TOE allows access to the security
functions, configuration, and associated data only by authorized users
and applications.
ï‚· FDP_ACC.1 requires that all user actions resulting in the access
to TOE security functions and configuration data are controlled
ï‚· FDP_ACF.1 supports FDP_ACC.1 by ensuring that access to TOE
security functions, configuration data, audit logs, and account
attributes is based on the user privilege level and their
allowable actions
ï‚· FIA_UID.2 requires the TOE to enforce identification of all users
prior to configuration of the TOE
ï‚· FIA_UAU.2 requires the TOE to enforce authentication of all
users prior to configuration of the TOE
ï‚· FIA_ATD.1 specifies security attributes for users of the TOE
ï‚· FMT_MTD.1 restricts the ability to query, add or modify TSF
data to authorized users.
ï‚· FMT_MSA.1 specifies that only privileged administrators can
access the TOE security functions and related configuration
data.
ï‚· FMT_MSA.2 specifies that only secure values are accepted for
security attributes listed with access control policies.
ï‚· FMT_MSA.3 ensures that the default values of security
attributes are restrictive in nature as to enforce the access
control policy for the TOE
ï‚· FTP_ITC.1 specifies that the trusted channel exists for components
HTTPS/TLS.
ï‚· FTP_TRP.1 specifies that the trusted path exists for components
HTTPS/TLS.

OBJECTIVE RATIONALE
O.PASSWD_PROT This objective ensures that the TOE provides cryptographic
mechanisms to generate and destroy keys. This objective is met by:
FCS_CKM.1, FCS_CKM. 4, and FCS_COP.1 which provide the
cryptographic support functions for secure communications within the
TOE and with external IT entities.
O.TRANS_PROT This objective ensures that the TOE protects data in transit between
elements within the TOE. This objective is met by FTP_ITC (which
specifies that the trusted channel exists for components) and FTP_TRP
(which ensures that the trusted path exists for components).

Table 22 â€“ Security Assurance Requirements at EAL3
Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
The ST specifies Evaluation Assurance Level 3. EAL3 was chosen because it is based upon good
commercial development practices with thorough functional testing. EAL3 provides the
developers and users a moderate level of independently assured security in conventional
commercial TOEs. The threat of malicious attacks is not greater than low, the security
environment provides physical protection, and the TOE itself offers a very limited interface,
June 1, 2020 NetIQ Identity Manager 4.7 ST
NetIQ Corporation Page 31 of 36
offering essentially no opportunity for an attacker to subvert the security policies without
physical access. The product was augmented to comply with ALC_FLR.2 in order to document
and address requirements for remediation and reporting of faults that may be discovered in the
product after release.

7. TOE Summary Specification
This section presents the Security Functions implemented by the TOE.
TOE Security Functions
The security functions performed by the TOE are as follows:
ï‚· Security Management
ï‚· Security Audit
ï‚· Identification and Authentication
ï‚· User Data Protection
ï‚· Trusted Path / Channels
ï‚· Cryptographic Support
Security Audit
The TOE generates the following audit data:
ï‚· Start-up and shutdown of the audit functions (instantiated by startup of the TOE)
ï‚· User login/logout
ï‚· Login failures
The TOE provides the Administrator with the capability to read all audit data generated within
the TOE via the console. The GUI provides a suitable means for an Administrator to interpret the
information from the audit log.
The A.TIMESOURCE is added to the assumptions on operational environment, and OE.TIME is
added to the operational environment security objectives. The time and date provided by the
operational environment are used to form the timestamps. The TOE ensures that the audit trail
data is stamped when recorded with a dependable date and time received from the OE
(operating system). In this manner, accurate time and date is maintained on the TOE.
The Security Audit function is designed to satisfy the following security functional requirements:
ï‚· FAU_GEN.1
ï‚· FAU_SAR.1
Identification and Authentication
The IDM console application provides user interfaces that administrators may use to manage
TOE functions. The operating system and the database in the TOE Environment are queried to
individually authenticate administrators or users. The TOE maintains authorization information
that determines which TOE functions an authenticated administrators or users (of a given role)
may perform.
The TOE maintains the following list of security attributes belonging to individual users:
ï‚· User Identity (i.e., user name)
ï‚· Authentication Status (whether the IT Environment validated the username/password)
ï‚· Privilege Level (Administrator or User)
The Identification and Authentication function is designed to satisfy the following security
functional requirements:
ï‚· FIA_ATD.1
ï‚· FIA_UAU.2
ï‚· FIA_UID.2
User Data Protection
June 1, 2020 NetIQ Identity Manager 4.7 ST
NetIQ Corporation Page 34 of 36
The TOE implements a discretionary access control policy to define what roles can access
particular functions of the TOE. All access and actions for system reports, component audit logs,
TOE configuration, operator account attributes (defined in FIA_ATD.1) are protected via access
control list. When a user requests to perform an action on an object, the TOE verifies the role
associated with the user name. Access is granted if the user (or group of users) has the specific
rights required for the type of operation requested on the object.
Identity Manager can enforce password policies on incoming passwords from connected
systems and on passwords set or changed through the User Application password self-service.
If the new password does not comply, you can specify that Identity Manager not accept the
password. This also means that passwords that don't comply with your policies are not
distributed to other connected systems.
In addition, can enforce password policies on connected systems. If the password being
published to the Identity Vault does not comply with rules in a policy, you can specify that
Identity Manager not only does not accept the password for distribution, but actually resets the
noncompliant password on the connected system by using the current Distribution password in
the Identity Vault.
The User Data Protection function is designed to satisfy the following security functional
requirements:
ï‚· FDP_ACC.1
ï‚· FDP_ACF.1
ï‚· FPT_TDC.1
Security Management
The TOE maintains the operator roles described in the following table. The individual roles are
categorized into two main roles: the Administrator and the User.
ROLE MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS
Administrator A user who has rights to configure and manage all aspects of the TOE
User The userâ€™s capabilities can be configured to:
View hierarchical relationships between User objects
View and edit user information (with appropriate rights).
Search for users or resources using advanced search criteria
(which can be saved for later reuse).
Recover forgotten passwords.
Table 24 â€“ Roles and Functions
Only an Administrator can determine the behavior of, disable, enable, and modify the behavior
of the functions that implement the Discretionary Access Control SFP. The TPE ensures only
secure values are accepted for the security attributes listed with Discretionary Access Control
SFP.
The Security Management function is designed to satisfy the following security functional
requirements:
ï‚· FMT_MTD.1
ï‚· FMT_MSA.1
ï‚· FMT_MSA.2
ï‚· FMT_MSA.3
ï‚· FMT_SMF.1
ï‚· FMT_SMR.1

Trusted Path / Channels
The Trusted Path/Channels function is designed to satisfy the following security functional
requirements:
ï‚· FTP_ITC.1 â€“ the TOE supports establishment of trusted channels for communicating
TOE entities using HTTPS.
ï‚· FTP_TRP.1 â€“ the TOE provides a trusted path for TOE Users, using HTTPS
Trusted Channel
The TOE provides a trusted channel between the TOE and external web servers.
Trusted channels are implemented using HTTPS. The TOE supports TLS v1.1 and TLS v1.2. The
TOE supports the following TLS cipher suites, as defined in RFC 2246, RFC 4346 and RFC 5246:
ï‚· TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
ï‚· TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
ï‚· TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
ï‚· TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
ï‚· TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_ CBC_SHA
ï‚· TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
Trusted Path:
The TOE provides a trusted path for TOE administrators and TOE users to communicate with
the TOE. The trusted path is implemented using HTTPS. The TOEâ€™s implementation of TLS is
described in the previous section (Trusted Channel).
Cryptographic Support
Cryptographic protection of data in transit between the TOE and remote users, and between
the TOE and external web servers is provided by the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module software
version 2.0.10 (Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) certificate number 1747)
libraries.
