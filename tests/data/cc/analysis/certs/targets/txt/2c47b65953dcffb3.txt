1.2 ST Overview
The firm Océ produces a wide range of multifunctional devices for copying, printing
and scanning (MFDs) for various purposes. A number of these MFDs: the 1055/65/75
series, the 2062 series and the 2075 series, use the same Digital Access Controller
(DAC).
The Océ Digital Access Controller (DAC) R9.1.6, is used with the Océ VarioPrint
• 1055, 1065, 1075, 2062, 2075.

For external DACs, an optional ‘removable hard disk’ is available.
The DAC is a PC-based MFD-controller that provides a wide range of printing and
scanning functionality to the Digital Copier (DC) of the MFD to which the DAC is
connected. The DAC provides security functionality to the DC, the DAC does not
provide copy functionality.
This Security Target describes the DAC and the specific security problem that it
addresses. The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a collection of software components
(printer drivers, OS) that use the underlying hardware platform. The TOE is a
subset of the complete DAC.

2. TOE Description
2.1 TOE Overview
This section presents an overview of the TOE.
2.1.1 TOE physical scope and boundary
The firm Océ produces a wide range of multifunctional devices for copying,
printing and scanning (MFDs). For the purpose of this evaluation, MFDs consist of
two main parts: a controller and a Digital Copier (DC).
A number of these MFDs use the same controller: the Digital Access Controller
(DAC).
The DAC is a PC-based MFD-controller that provides a wide range of printing and
scanning functionality to the Digital Copier (DC) of the MFD to which the DAC is
connected. The DAC provides security functionality to the DC. It does not provide
copy functionality.
The DAC can operate in three different security modes: ‘high’, ‘normal’ and ‘low’.
This Security Target covers the DAC operating in the security mode ‘high’ as
delivered by Océ to the customer. This mode provides a restricted set of
functionality that is configured to meet the Security Target claim. Changing the
operational mode invalidates the claim made in this Security Target.
The DAC is connected between a network and the DC. This is depicted in Figure 1.

25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
The DAC consists of:
1. A embedded uATX motherboard based PC comprising at a minimum a Via
Eden C3 800 MHz processor, 256MB internal RAM, 20GB hard drive,
2. Generic graphics card and network card supporting 10/100/1000Mbs
Ethernet UTP.
3. USB hardware support.
4. Drivers for the PC, graphics card and network card
5. The Montvista Linux operating system version 4.0
6. Océ DAC-specific software version R9.1.6
7. Third-party developed software: Adobe PS3-PDF Interpreter, Version
3016.103 v.3.1 build #03; Apache HTTP server with SSL support, Apache
2.0.55, OpenSSL 0.9.7e (used for remote system administration) and
OpenSSL 0.9.7d (used for job forwarding), mod_ssl 2.8.22.
Of these 7, the first four are not part of the TOE and together form the underlying
hardware platform that the TOE makes use of. The underlying hardware platform
does not provide any specific security related functionality for the TOE. The TSF is
mediated by the last three software components that are part of the TOE. This is
depicted in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Division of the DAC into TOE and non-TOE.
The underlying PC hardware platform has the following characteristics:
• The USB port is used by the service engineer for administration and for
attaching the Varioprint MFD to the DAC. It is also possible to print jobs
stored on a USB memory stick and scan jobs to a USB memory stick. No

other devices are attached to the USB ports that are not related to the
normal operation of the DAC.
• All other interfaces, such as the keyboard or other ports, have been
disabled.
The physical interfaces through which the TOE communicates are:
• A USB connector through which a service engineer can install and
administer the TOE
• A network card through which print and scan jobs can pass and a remote
system administrator can administer the TOE
• A USB connector that allows for data flows between the Digital Copier
(DC) and the TOE via the DAC cable.
• A USB connector through which print jobs can be sent the DAC for
printing and for receiving scan jobs from the DAC.
The user guidance for the TOE consists of :
• Océ VarioPrint 1055-75 Job manual
• Océ VarioPrint 2062 Job manual
• Océ VarioPrint 2075 Job manual
• Océ VarioPrint 1055-75 Configuration manual
• Océ VarioPrint 2062 Configuration manual
• Océ VarioPrint 2075 Configuration manual
These manuals are delivered in paper form with the DAC and can also be
downloaded from the support section from Océ corporate website (www.oce.com)
In addition to the manuals listed above, the usage of the DAC in the configuration
described in this Security Target is defined in:
Common Criteria Certified Configuration of the DAC R9.1.6
This document is not delivered to the customer with the TOE and must be
downloaded from the support section from Océ corporate website (www.oce.com).
The administrator guidance for the TOE consists of:

The DAC administration guidance for the Océ service engineer takes the form of a
Lotus Notes application that is installed on the service engineer’s laptop. The
guidance contains an appendix that is identified as:
• Administrating version R9.1.6 of the Océ DAC,
and is a frozen version of the Océ service engineer Lotus Notes application made at
the time of product release.

2.1.2 TOE logical scope and boundary
The TOE protects two assets: itself and the print jobs it receives.
1. The TOE protects it’s own integrity against threats from the LAN, service
engineer laptop, USB memory sticks and the Digital Copier to which it is
attached through use of a firewall and integrity checks on system files upon
system reboot.
2. The TOE protects the confidentiality of secure print jobs once they have
been received by the DAC by storing them until the user authenticates
himself to the DAC via a user interface on the DC. The DAC shreds the
data after printing is completed.
The TOE does not form a threat to its environment for the following reasons:
• The TOE does not form a threat to the integrity of the LAN to which the
DAC is attached. The TOE configuration has been tested and is configured
so that the integrity of the configuration is checked and restored upon
system reset.
• Additionally, all data that enters the TOE via the Digital Copier must pass
through an internal firewall. There is no direct line from the Digital Copier
to the network to which the DAC is attached.
In order to do so, it offers the following functionality1:
1 The DC can also perform copying, but this is done without interaction with the
TOE. Copy job related data does not enter the TOE boundary. This is therefore
out-of-scope of this ST.
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 14 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
The TOE controls printing
The TOE accepts Postscript, PDF, PCL5e, PCL6 print jobs from remote users on
the network (lpr over TCP/IP or raw print data via a raw IP socket). The TOE also
accepts jobs printed by a remote user (commonly know as ‘print to file’) that have
been copied to a USB stick that is then inserted into the DAC by local users
through a USB port located in the DC Local User Interface console shown below.
Figure 3: The DC LUI console showing the USB connector used for printing and scanning
and the optional fingerprint sensor that used for identifying mailbox owners
The DAC processes these print jobs and provides these as images to the attached
DC. The TOE can print these jobs in three different ways. The remote users can
select the way in which each of his jobs is printed from a printer settings dialog box
on the screen of their PC.
Automatic printing
The TOE receives a print job from a remote end-user or from an inserted USB
memory stick, and stores it in a queue. Once this job is the first one in the queue,
the TOE processes this print job into images, and sends these images to the
attached DC for printing.
Mailbox printing
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 15 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
The TOE receives a print job from a remote end-user or from an inserted USB
memory stick, and stores it internally. The end-user then has to go physically to
the DC (become a local end-user) and identify himself at the Local User Interface
of the DC (LUI) either by selecting his name from a list displayed on the LUI
screen or by using the optional fingerprint sensor. Only after this, will the TOE
process the job. The resulting images are sent to the attached DC for printing.
The fingerprint sensor is an optional feature of the MFD that is not always present.
The sensor hardware is not part of the TOE but is part of the DC
(see figure 3) and connects to the TOE via a TOE-DC USB cable. The software
support for the use of the sensor is always present in the TOE. The user
identification credentials can either be stored in a remote LDAP server or in an
internal database within the DAC. The internal database within the DAC is part of
the TOE but is not security enforcing.
Secure printing
This is similar to mailbox printing, with two differences:
• When submitting the print job, the remote end-user adds a job-specific
PINcode that has a length of 4 to 6 digits to the job.
• The PINcode is stored in the DAC.
• After identifying himself at the LUI of the DC as described in mailbox
printing, the local end-user also has to provide the job-specific PINcode in
order to authenticate himself. The DC interrogates the DAC as to the
validity of the PIN. If correct, the print job data is released by the DAC and
is sent to the DC. A replay attack with an intercepted PIN is countered by
shredding the print job data immediately after the print job is completed.
The end-users and interfaces they interact with are depicted in Figure 4.
Figure 4: End-users and interfaces for printing
The TOE is configured to destroy the data relating to secure print jobs (print jobs
submitted to the mailbox with an associated PIN), non-secure print jobs, scan jobs
and temporary files.

This is achieved by writing over the job related data with other data, thereby
making it difficulty to retrieve the original data.
The TOE administrators can select the number of write iterations and at what
moment the shredding takes place. The first iteration takes place after the data is
released. The remaining iterations can take place immediately (synchronous) or
with low priority in the background (asynchronous).
Additionally, the TOE is also configured to shred all data at the end of each
working day by specifying a specific time interval no greater than once every 24
hours.

The TOE controls print jobs that are re-routed to DACs elsewhere on the
network
Local end-users can re-route print jobs that have been submitted to their mail box
(see mail box printing above) to other DACs that are attached on the network. This
functionality does not support the re-routing of secure print jobs (see secure
printing above).
This functionality is provided for a situation whereby the remote end-user, having
submitted a print job to a DAC, walks to another MFD located elsewhere in the
operational environment and thereby becomes a local end-user at a DAC where the
print job is not located. They can then re-route their mail box print job from the
original DAC to another MFD and print their document there. The original DAC
maintains a list of ‘friendly DACs’ (officially known as smart mailbox members)
that can request mailbox print jobs to be re-routed. The re-routing of secure print
jobs is not permitted.
The local end-user must identify himself by selecting their name or my entering a
value which will be used to retrieve their identification details from a LDAP server
located elsewhere on the network.
The end-users and interfaces they interact with are depicted in Figure 5

The TOE controls scan jobs
Local end-users can scan documents on the DC, and the resulting images will then
be submitted to the TOE. The TOE can process the images to a variety of file
formats and then transfer the resulting files by ftp to an ftp-server on the network
or by SMTP to an e-mail server on the network or to a USB memory stick if
present on the DC LUI console.
The end-users and interfaces they interact with are depicted in Figure 6.
Figure 6: End-users and interfaces for scanning
The TOE can be managed
As indicated in the previous sections, the MFD (of which the TOE is a part)
supports local and remote end-users. The MFD also supports various
administrators, which are described briefly here:
Key Operator: These are typically administrators or secretaries from the
organization owning/renting the TOE. They can interact with the DC through the
LUI, and through this interaction have access to a limited amount of non-security
related settings of the TOE.
Remote System administrator (HTTPS): These are remote administrators, typically
a network administrator from the organization owning/renting the TOE. They can
change a less limited set of settings of the TOE through a HTTP over SSL
connection (HTTPS). The remote administrator can identify the TOE via a

certificate. Help files for the administrator are also delivered via the HTTPS
connection. Web pages that are delivered via the HTTPS connection are ‘non-
cacheable’.
Remote System administrator (SNMP): These are remote administrators, typically a
network administrator from the organization owning/renting the TOE. They can
read and write a limited set of non-security related settings of the TOE through a
SNMP connection.
Service engineer: These are local administrators, and are typically employed by
Océ. They have access through a USB connection to a wide range of settings on the
TOE and the DC. The TOE connection is PIN code protected.
The various administrators and the interfaces through which they interact with the
TOE are depicted in Figure 7.

The TOE has minimized all other functionality
The TOE supports TCP/IP: all other network protocols are disabled. The TOE
manufacturer has closed all network ports except those that are absolutely
necessary to its functioning. This includes the physical connectors on the TOE. The
TOE has further restricted the functionality behind each open network port to that
which is absolutely necessary to its functioning. This is done to maximize the
integrity of the TOE itself and minimize the risk of the TOE being infected or
hacked and subsequently being used as a stepping-stone to damage the network.
The availability of security related functionality
As depicted in Figure 7, The Key Operator is not able to influence the security of
the TOE as they have no access to security settings via the DC. The Service
Engineer cannot influence the security of the TOE via the interface to the DC.
Because the Key Operator and Local End-User cannot access security related
settings on the DAC, they cannot affect the TOE. For the sake of clarity, Figure 8
shows the interfaces to the TOE and the subjects that can access and manage TOE
security settings.

3. TOE Security Environment
The TOE is intended to provide scan and print functionality to users requiring a
low to moderate level of security assurance. Additional environmental and
organisational requirements support the security functionality provided by the
TOE.

To facilitate definition of threats, OSPs, assumptions, security objectives and
security requirements, we define the subjects, objects and operations to be used in
the ST first.
3.1.1 Non-human subjects
The systems (equipment) that will be interacting with the TOE (in alphabetical
order):
S.DIGITAL_COPIER A device that physically renders a print job or scans in a
job and is attached to the TOE via a cable.
S.NETWORK_DEVICE An unspecified network device that is logically
connected to the TOE and is located in the same
operating environment (office building).
3.1.2 Human subjects
The users (or subject acting on behalf of that user) that will be interacting with the
TOE are:
S.REMOTE_USER A person located within the operational environment of
the TOE who is aware of how the TOE should be used.
They are not malicious towards the TOE but are
capable of making mistakes when operating it.
S.REMOTE_USER typically sends print jobs from their
desktop PC to the TOE
S.LOCAL_USER A person located within the operational environment of
the TOE who is aware of how the TOE should be used.
They are not malicious towards the TOE but are
capable of making mistakes when operating it. They
may be interested in the content of other users’ print
jobs. S.LOCAL_USER typically interacts indirectly
with the TOE via S.DIGITAL_COPIER
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN A person who can change some TOE settings using a
Océ supplied interface. They are trusted by the
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 22 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
customer and are adequately trained. They are capable
of making mistakes. They connect to the TOE via the
network.
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER A person with elevated privileges above those of
S.LOCAL_USER and S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN. This
person is an Océ representative and accesses the TOE
locally through an USB interface. They are not
malicious towards the TOE but are capable of making
mistakes when operating it.
S.THIEF S.THIEF (cleaning staff, burglar, visitor, in rare cases a
user) will have no moral issues in stealing the TOE or
parts of it. Once S.THIEF has stolen the TOE or parts
of it he may attempt to retrieve earlier printer and
scanner jobs from the TOE. S.THIEF is not able to steal
Copy jobs2 as they never enter the TOE. S.THIEF is
opportunistic and is not a recurring visitor to the
environment in which the TOE operates.
Note that the key operator is not included as a subject that interacts with the TOE
as he is not able to make changes to the security settings of the TOE and is
therefore equal to S.LOCAL_USER with respect to security.
3.1.3 Objects
The (data) objects for the TOE that the TOE will operate upon are:
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB A secure print job submitted by S.REMOTE_USER to
the TOE over the network or by S.LOCAL_USER via a
USB memory stick that has been inserted into the MFD
LUI console.. D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB has the
Security Attribute Username/PIN associated with them.
D.PRINT_JOB A non D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB type print job
submitted either by S.REMOTE_USER to the TOE
over the network, by S.LOCAL_USER via a USB
memory stick that has been inserted into the MFD LUI
console or by another MFD located elsewhere on the
network.
D.SCAN_JOB Data that is scanned in via the DC attached to the DAC.
Data is sent from the TOE to a FTP or e-mail server
located elsewhere on the network or to a USB memory
stick that has been inserted into the MFD LUI console.
2 See Figure 1: Relation between DC, DAC and MFD.

25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
D.INBOUND_TRAFFIC TCP/IP network packets received by the TOE.
D.INBOUND_TRAFFIC has the Security Attributes
Port and Protocol associated with it.
D.OUTBOUND_TRAFFIC TCP/IP network packets sent by the TOE.
D.OUTBOUND_TRAFFIC has the Security Attributes
Port and Protocol associated with it.
3.1.4 Operations
The operations that are performed by the TOE are:
R.RELEASE_JOB The TOE processes and releases a
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB to the attached DC.
R.PRINT_JOB The TOE processes and releases a D.PRINT_JOB to the
attached DC.
R.FORWARD_JOB The TOE processes and releases a D.PRINT_JOB to the
attached network.
R.SCAN_JOB The TOE processes and releases a D.SCAN_JOB to the
attached network
R.SHRED_JOB The TOE shreds redundant D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB,
D.PRINT_JOB, D.SCAN_JOB data objects from the
TOE’s hard disk.
R.ENTER_TOE The TOE allows D.INBOUND_TRAFFIC to enter its
boundary.
R.EXIT_TOE The TOE allows D.OUTBOUND_TRAFFIC to leave
its boundary.
3.2 Assumptions
A.DIGITAL_COPIER It is assumed that the TOE has a S.DIGITAL_COPIER
device attached to it. S.DIGITAL_COPIER is an Océ
VarioPrint 1055-75, 2062 or 2075 Digital Copier. When
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB is sent to
S.DIGITAL_COPIER, R.REMOTE_USER will specify
a PIN of at least 4 and a maximum of 6 digits and,
whether the job is printed or not, will delete the job on
the same workday. Employees are aware of this
requirement.
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 24 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
A.ENVIRONMENT The TOE assumes that its operational environment is a
regular office environment. Physical access to the
operational environment is restricted. No parts of the
TOE will leave the operational environment during
normal operational ownership unless the product is
being returned to the manufacturer as part of flaw
remediation or end of ownership. The environment
contains non-threatening office personnel
(S.LOCAL_USER, S.REMOTE_USER,
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER). S.THIEF is only rarely
present in this environment and not on a recurring basis.
A.SECURITY_POLICY It is assumed that the customer will have a Security
Policy governing the use of IT products by employees
in the customer organisation. The TOE assumes that the
network to which it is attached is protected by security
measures that are intended to prevent mal-ware, viruses
and network traffic, not related to the working of the
operational environment, entering the network to which
it is attached. Although the Virus database files and
various patches are kept up to date, the policy
recognises that new threats emerge over time and that
occasionally they may enter the environment from
outside and provides measures to help limit the damage.
The Policy will define how IT products are protected
against threats originating from outside the customer
organisation. The organisation’s employees are aware
of, are trained in and operate according to the terms and
conditions of the policy. The policy also covers
physical security and the need for employees to work in
a security aware manner including the usage of the
TOE. The Security Policy describes and requires a low
to medium level of assurance (EAL2) for the TOE.
A.SHREDDING The TOE assumes that the customer will not disable the
shredding operation for D.PRINT_JOB and
D.SCAN_JOB data objects3.
A.SLA It is assumed that any security flaws discovered in the
TOE will be repaired by Océ (possibly as part of an
agreed service level agreement).
3 The TOE shreds D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB by
default when printing/scanning is completed in the delivered mode. It is possible
to disable shredding for D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB. If this happens, the
TOE claim is no longer valid.

25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
3.3 Threats
T.RESIDUAL_DATA S.THIEF steals the TOE or parts thereof and retrieves
stored or deleted D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB. The
motivation for S.THIEF to attack the TOE is low
because it requires sophisticated data recovery
equipment that can recover data even after the
shredding mechanism has executed to recover data that
has little value to the attacker.
T.NOSY_USER S.LOCAL_USER accesses a D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB
that does not belong to him/her that is stored in the
DAC. The motivation to carry out this attack is low.
T.MALWARE A S.NETWORK_DEVICE is used by malware that
may have entered the TOE’s operational environment to
launch an attack on the integrity of the TOE.
Alternatively S.DIGITAL_COPIER is used by malware
to launch an attack on the integrity of
S.NETWORK_DEVICE. The motivation to carry out
this attack is low.
3.4 Organisational Security Policies
P.JOB_DELETE When D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINTJOB and
D.SCANJOB objects are no longer needed by the TOE,
they will be deleted by the TOE at the earliest available
opportunity in a manner that meets a recognised
standard.
P.TOE_ADMINISTRATION The modification of TOE security settings shall be
restricted to S.SERVICE_ENGINEER and
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN.

4. Security Objectives
4.1 TOE Security Objectives
This section consists of two groups of objectives:
• Functional Security Objectives for the TOE, that deal with what the TOE must
do;
• Assurance Security Objectives for the TOE, that deal with how much
assurance one should have in that the TOE does what it is expected to.
4.1.1 Functional Security Objectives for the TOE
O.F.INBOUND_FILTER The TOE will only support TCP/IP as a network
protocol. D.INBOUND_TRAFFIC shall only enter the
TOE (R.ENTER_TOE) if its Port is specified as being
open in Appendix D.
O.F.OUTBOUND_FILTER The TOE will only support TCP/IP as a network
protocol. D.OUTBOUND_TRAFFIC shall only exit the
TOE (R.EXIT_TOE) if its Port is specified as being
open in Appendix D.
O.F.JOB_RELEASE The TOE shall only perform R.RELEASE_JOB once
S.LOCAL_USER has successfully identified and
authenticated himself as owner of
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB.
O.F.JOB_SHRED The TOE shall delete all D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB,
D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB data as soon as it is
no longer required or during the start-up procedure if
residual D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB and
D.SCAN_JOB is found on the TOE’s hard disk. The
first write cycle will either immediately after the job has
completed or once the TOE enters an idle state. The
data shall be deleted according to a recognised standard
so that it cannot be reconstituted.
O.F.AUTHENTICATE The TOE ensures that S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER must authenticate themselves
to the TOE before allowing them to modify the TOE
security settings.
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 27 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
O.F.SELFTEST The TOE will perform check of the integrity of the TSF
when it is re-booted.
4.1.2 Assurance Security Objectives for the TOE
O.A.SLA The TOE shall be evaluated to ALC_FLR.1
4.2 Security Objectives for the environment
O.E.ENVIRONMENT The environment into which the TOE will be introduced
is protected by physical measures that limit access
S.LOCAL_USER, S.REMOTE_USER,
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER. The physical measures are
adequate to prevent all other persons but a determined
S.THIEF who deliberately wants to steal part of or all
of the TOE by methodically planning an attack on the
TOE over a period of time.
O.E.NETWORK_POLICYThe network to which the TOE is attached shall be
adequately protected so that the TOE is not visible
outside the network. In addition, measures shall be
implemented to only allow connections to the TOE
from devices situated on the same network. No inbound
connections from external networks are allowed. The
network scans data for mal-ware (viruses and worms).
This type of data may originate from either inside or
outside the network to which the TOE is attached and
includes the TOE itself.
O.E.DEPLOYMENT The network (LAN) to which the TOE is attached is
well managed with established procedures for
introducing and attaching new devices to the network.
O.E.DIGITAL_COPIER The environment into which the TOE will be introduced
shall contain an Océ VarioPrint 1055-75, 2062 or 2075
Digital Copier that provides a Local User Interface and
Glass Plate through which S.LOCAL_USER can
interact easily with the TOE (selecting username and
entering PINcode). When sending a
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB to the Digital Copier,
S.REMOTE_USER shall specify a PIN that consists of
a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 digits and,
whether or not it is printed, will ensure the print job is
deleted from the TOE during the same workday that the
job is sent. The DC provides a glass plate and LUI with
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 28 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
which S.LOCAL_USER can perform scan jobs. The ST
claim is not valid when the TOE is used with any other
type of Océ Digital Copier. The TOE will not work
with any other device (including Digital Copiers from
any other manufacturers).
O.E.SHREDDING The customer requires the shredding of
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB and
D.SCAN_JOB data objects4
4 The TOE shreds D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB by
default when printing/scanning is completed in the delivered mode. It is possible
to disable shredding for D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB. If this happens, the
TOE claim in no longer valid.

Dependencies: FDP_ACF.1 (included)
FDP_ACF.1 Security attribute based access control
FDP_ACF1.1 The TSF shall enforce the NETWORK_POLICY to
objects based on the following:

• Protocol.
FDP_ACF.1.2 The TSF shall enforce the following rules to determine if an
operation among controlled subjects and controlled objects is allowed:
• The TOE shall perform R.ENTER_TOE on
D.INBOUND_TRAFFIC only if
Port(D.INBOUND_TRAFFIC) = DAC, ICMP, DNS, DHCP,
LDAP, LPR, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SNMP, SMTP, SSH,
“RAW_SOCKET”5 and Protocol = TCP/IP
• The TOE shall perform R.EXIT_TOE on
D.OUTBOUND_TRAFFIC only if
Port(D.OUTBOUND_TRAFFIC) = DAC, ICMP, DNS, DHCP,

objects based on the following additional rules:
• none
FDP_ACF.1.4 The TSF shall explicitly deny access of subjects to objects
based on the following additional rules:

‘raw socket’ are used to refer to the port in the firewall through which the data can
flow.

5.1.2 SFRs for Job Release
FIA_UID.1 Timing of identification (Secure Printing)
FIA_UID.1.1 The TSF shall allow R.PRINT_JOB, R.FORWARD_JOB
and R.SCAN_JOB on behalf of the S.LOCAL_USER to be performed
before S.LOCAL_USER is identified.
FIA_UID.1.2 The TSF shall require S.LOCAL_USER to be successfully
identified before allowing R.RELEASE_JOB on behalf of
S.LOCAL_USER.
Dependencies: No dependencies.
FIA_UAU.1 Timing of authentication
FIA_UAU.1.1 The TSF shall allow R.PRINT_JOB, R.FORWARD_JOB
and R.SCAN_JOB on behalf of the S.LOCAL_USER to be performed
before S.LOCAL_USER is authenticated.

S.LOCAL_USER.
Dependencies: FIA_UID.1 (included)
5.1.3 SFRs for Shredding
FDP_RIP.1 Subset residual; information protection
FDP_RIP.1.16 The TSF shall ensure that any previous information content
of a resource is made unavailable upon the
deallocation of the resource from the following objects:
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB, D.SCAN_JOB
6 This is a refinement to show when the de-allocation is to take place. When you
delete a file, the OS modifies the relevant entry from the file allocation table. The
data remains on the hard disk and can be retrieved with suitable tools. This is why
the TOE shreds the data. What is happening is that:
• When the job manager discards data, it moves the data reference in the file
allocation table to a location that is dedicated to the E-shred subsystem.
• The E-shred subsystem then erases the data (makes the data unavailable) by
overwriting the data several times.
• The E-shred service then removes the reference to the erased data from the
file allocation table so that the erased disk resources can be re-used.

• on start-up or reboot of the TOE.7
Dependencies: No dependencies.
5.1.4 SFRs for Management
FIA_UID.2 User identification before any action
FIA_UID.2.1 The TSF shall require S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER to identify themselves before allowing any
other TSF-mediated actions on the behalf of that user.
Dependencies: No dependencies.
FIA_UAU.2 User authentication before any action
FIA_UAU.2.1 The TSF shall require S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and

allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on the behalf of that user.
Dependencies: FIA_UID.1 (included)
FMT_MOF.1 Management of security functions behaviour

of the functions described in appendix D for S.SERVICE_ENGINEER
to S.SERVICE_ENGINEER..
Dependencies: FMT_SMF.1 (included)
FMT_SMR.1 (included)
7 The DAC can experience errors and sometimes require restarting to handle these
errors (or users restart the photocopier anyway in an attempt to handle these
errors). It is therefore important that the photocopier also deletes data whenever it
is restarted.

25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
FMT_MSA.1 Management of security attributes
FMT_MSA.1.1 The TSF shall enforce the NETWORK_POLICY to
restrict the ability to change the default 8 security attributes Port and
Protocol to nobody.9
Dependencies: FDP_ACC.1 (included)
FMT_SMF.1 (included)
FMT_SMR.1 (included)
FMT_MSA.3 Static Attribute initialisation
FMT_MSA.3.1 The TSF shall enforce the NETWORK_POLICY to
provide restrictive default values for security attributes that are used to
enforce the SFP.
FMT_MSA.3.2 The TSF shall allow nobody10 to specify alternative initial
values to override the default values when an object or information is
created.
Dependencies: FMT_MSA.1 (included)
FMT_SMR.1 (included)
FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions
FMT_SMF.1.1 The TSF shall be capable of performing the following
security management functions as described in appendix D:
Functions related to R.SHRED_JOB that are available to
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and S.SERVICE_ENGINEER
• Set the number of shred runs
• Set the shredding moment
• Shred print jobs: yes/no (D.PRINT_JOB)11
• Shred scan jobs: yes/no (D.SCAN_JOB)12
Dependencies: No dependencies.
FMT_SMR.1 Security roles
8 For grammatical and clarity reasons, the underscore between change and default
was removed and the word ‘the’ before security attributes was moved to between
’change’ and ‘default’.
9 The TOE does not allow any users to change any security attributes in the evaluated
configuration.
10 The word ‘the’ before ‘nobody’ was removed for grammatical reasons.
11 Disabling these functions will invalidate the Security Target claim. The functions
are available but there is an Organisational Security Policy that defines that they
should be enabled by default.
12 See footnote 11
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 33 of 63

FMT_SMR.1.1 The TSF shall maintain the roles
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN, S.SERVICE_ENGINEER and
S.LOCAL_USER.
FMT_SMR1.2 The TSF shall be able to associate users with roles.
Dependencies: FIA_UID.1 (included)
5.1.5 SFRs for Protection of the TSF itself
FPT_SEP.1 TSF domain separation
FPT_SEP1.1 The TSF shall maintain a security domain for its own
execution that protects it from interference and tampering by untrusted
subjects.
FPT_SEP.1.2 The TSF shall enforce separation between the security
domains of subjects in the TSC.
Dependencies: No dependencies.
FPT_RVM.1 Non-bypassability of the TSP
FPT_RVM.1.1 The TSF shall ensure that TSP enforcement functions are
invoked and succeed before each function within the TSC is allowed to
proceed.
Dependencies: No dependencies
FPT_TST.1 TSF testing
FPT_TST.1.1 The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up
to demonstrate the correct operation of the TSF.
FPT_TST.1.2 The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to
verify the integrity of the TSF data.
FPT_TST.1.3 The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to
verify the integrity of stored TSF executable code.
Dependencies: FPT_AMT.1 (not included)13
13 The dependency FPT_AMT.1 Abstract machine is not included, because the
underlying IT platform does not contribute to the TOE requirements (See part 1,
paragraph 147). The underlying PC platform is a standard PC platform that works.
Testing of the platform does not provide assurance that will support the claims at
the level of EAL2, as functional testing of the DAC in its operational environment
is performed (it does what it should do).

6. TOE Summary Specification
6.1 IT Security Functions
SF.FILTERING
The TOE uses a built-in firewall to block ports and ICMP commands that are not
needed for the operation of the TOE. In addition all network protocols that are not
supported in the security mode ‘high’ are disabled.
By default no traffic is permitted to enter or leave to TOE except for the TCP/IP
packets and the restricted ICMP command set via the ports defined in the rule
table.
SF.JOB_RELEASE
The TOE verifies the identity and associated PIN code that was send with the print
job when submitted by S.REMOTE_USER with Username/PIN received from
S.LOCAL_USER via the DC interface. If verification is successful, the secure print
job is released for printing.
SF.SHREDDING
Once a print or scan job has been deleted, the data is overwritten. It is possible to
perform multiple write cycles, with various patterns being applied. At least three
write cycles will always take place. S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN or
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER can choose the moment when the shredding cycle
commences. The first write cycle can occur immediately after the print job has
completed or to improve job throughput performance, once the TOE enters an idle
state. The remaining cycles may also take place immediately after the print job has
been completed or also at the time when the TOE enters an idle state. The
shredding mechanism supports US DOD 5220-22m and Gutmann algorithms15.
SF.MANAGEMENT
The TOE can be managed in relation to SF.JOB_RELEASE and SF.SHREDDING.
In order to gain access, the S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN or S.SERVICE_ENGINEER
must authenticate themselves to the TOE. S.SERVICE_ENGINEER does this by
entering a password. S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN authenticates himself by entering a
password. The TOE is delivered by Océ with pre-configured in the security mode
‘high’. This provides the most restrictive set of operational settings.
SF.SELFTEST
During start-up the TOE will check the hard disk files system and the integrity of
the software the forms the TOE. If defects in the hard disk files system are
15 See Appendix B – References for more information relating to these algorithms
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 37 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
detected, the corrupted file system will be automatically repaired. The software
includes all executables (operating system executables, Océ authored DAC
executables, Third party software executables and DAC system settings). If defects
are detected, the corrupted data will be replaced by correct shadow data.
6.1.1 Probabilistic functions and mechanisms
The TOE contains probabilistic functions and mechanisms in the form of
passwords and PIN numbers that are used for the authentication of
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and S.SERVICE_ENGINEER respectively. There is
also a probabilistic function and mechanisms that protects
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB and is used for the authentication of S.LOCAL_USER.
Subject Function Mechanism
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN SF.MANAGEMENT,
SF.SHREDDING
For HTTPS based
management. an alpha-
numeric password (ASCII
characters 32-126) ranging
in length between 5 and 50
digits is used. After the first
failed attempt, a delay
mechanism is invoked.
There are no security
management functions or
access to the assets that the
TOE protects that are
accessible via the SNMP
connection.
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER SF.MANAGEMENT,
SF.SHREDDING
An alpha-numeric password
(ASCII characters 32-126)
ranging in length between 6
and 50 digits is used. The
default password is changed
during the customer site
installation process.
S.LOCAL_USER SF.JOB_RELEASE A numeric pin code varying
in length from 4 to 6 digits.
6.1.2 Strength of function claim
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 38 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
The SFRs FIA_UID.1, FIA_UAU.1, FIA_UID.2 and FIA_UAU.2 require the TOE
to provide security functions that provide identification/authentication functionality
that meets a SOF claim of ‘SOF basic’.
A strength of function claim of ‘SOF basic’ is made for the security functions
SF.JOB_RELEASE and SF.MANAGEMENT. These are the security functions
that implement FIA_UID.1, FIA_UAU.1, FIA_UID.2 and FIA_UAU.2.
6.2 Assurance Measures
Appropriate assurance measures are employed to satisfy the security assurance
requirements. The following list gives a mapping between the assurance
requirements and the documents containing the information needed for the
fulfilment of the respective requirement.
Configuration Management (ACM) assurance measures

8. Rationale
8.1 Security Objectives Rationale
For each assumption, threat and OSP we demonstrate that it is met by the security
objectives. The tracings are provided in the following table.
The individual rationales demonstrating that the threats, assumptions and
organizational security policies are met are described as follows:
A.DIGITAL_COPIER
The assumption is met by the following TOE assurance objective:
O.E.DIGITAL_COPIER - The environment into which the TOE will be introduced
shall contain an Océ VarioPrint 2045-65, 2050-70 or 31x5 Digital Copier that
provides a Local User Interface and Glass Plate through which S.LOCAL_USER
can interact easily with the TOE (selecting Username and entering PINcode).
When sending a D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB to the Digital Copier,

P.JOB_DELETE X
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 42 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
S.REMOTE_USER is aware that they must specify a PIN that consists of a
minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 digits and shall delete the job on the same
workday that it is sent to the TOE, whether or not it is printed. The DC provides a
glass plate and LUI with which S.LOCAL_USER can perform scan jobs. The ST
claim is not valid when the TOE is used with any other type of Océ Digital Copier.
The TOE will not work with any other device (including Digital Copiers from any
other manufacturers).
Although the assumption states that a Digital Copier from Océ will be used, the
Digital Copier is an un-trusted device. The chances of an attack on the LAN being
mounted via the Digital Copier interface are reduced by the TOE filtering the
outbound traffic so that only ports that are absolutely necessary for the operation of
the TOE are open. Requiring D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB to be deleted from the
TOE on the same workday it is sent reduces the time available to an attacker in
which the data object is vulnerable. Additionally the access to the job is limited by
specifying a minimum PIN length.
A.ENVIRONMENT
The assumption is met by the following objectives for the environment:
O.E.ENVIRONMENT - The environment into which the TOE will be introduced is
protected by physical measures that limit access S.LOCAL_USER,
S.REMOTE_USER, S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and S.SERVICE_ENGINEER.
The physical measures are adequate to prevent all other persons but a determined
S.THIEF who deliberately wants to steal part of or all of the TOE by methodically
planning an attack on the TOE over a period of time. Normally, unless a fault
develops in the TOE, the TOE will no leave the environment into which it is
introduced
A.SECURITY_POLICY
The assumption is met by the following objectives for the environment:
O.E.NETWORK_POLICY - The network to which the TOE is attached shall be
adequately protected so that the TOE is not visible outside the network. In addition,
measures shall be implemented to only allow connections to the TOE from devices
situated on the same network. No inbound connections from external networks are
allowed. The network scans data for mal-ware (viruses and worms). This type of
data may originate from either inside or outside the network to which the TOE is
attached and includes the TOE itself.
O.E.DEPLOYMENT - The network (LAN) to which the TOE is attached is well
managed with established procedures for introducing and attaching new devices to
the network.
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 43 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
O.E.DIGITAL_COPIER - The environment into which the TOE will be introduced
shall contain an Océ VarioPrint 1055-75, 2062 or 2075 Digital Copier that provides
a Local User Interface and Glass Plate through which S.LOCAL_USER can
interact easily with the TOE (selecting Username and entering PINcode). When
sending a D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB to the Digital Copier, S.REMOTE_USER is
aware that they must specify a PIN that consists of a minimum of 4 and a
maximum of 6 digits and shall delete the job on the same workday that it is sent to
the TOE, whether or not it is printed. The DC provides a glass plate and LUI with
which S.LOCAL_USER can perform scan jobs. The ST claim is not valid when the
TOE is used with any other type of Océ Digital Copier. The TOE will not work
with any other device (including Digital Copiers from any other manufacturers).
O.E.SHREDDING – The customer requires the shredding of
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB data objects.
The TOE shreds D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB by
default when printing/scanning is completed in the delivered mode. It is possible to
disable shredding for D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB. If this happens, the TOE
claim in no longer valid.
A.SHREDDING
The assumption is met by the following objectives for the environment:
O.E.SHREDDING – The customer requires the shredding of
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB data objects.
The TOE shreds D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB by
default when printing/scanning is completed in the delivered mode. It is possible to
disable shredding for D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB. If this happens, the TOE
claim in no longer valid.
A.SLA
The assumption is met by the following TOE assurance objective:
O.A.SLA - The TOE shall be evaluated to ALC_FLR.1.There are measures in
place to repair faults in the TOE when they occur.
T.RESIDUAL_DATA
The threat is met by the following TOE functional objective:
O.F.JOB_SHRED - The TOE shall delete all D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB,
D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB data as soon as it is no longer required or
during the start-up procedure if residual D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB
and D.SCAN_JOB is found on the TOE’s hard disk. The first write cycle will
either immediately after the job has completed or once the TOE enters an idle state.
The data shall be deleted according to a recognised standard so that it cannot be
reconstituted.
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 44 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
‘Scrubbing’ the data from the hard disk when it is no longer needed helps prevent
the data been accessed by unauthorised persons.
T.NOSY_USER
The threat is met by the following TOE functional objective:
O.F.JOB_RELEASE - The TOE shall only perform R.RELEASE_JOB once
S.LOCAL_USER has successfully identified and authenticated himself as owner of
D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB.
By first requiring a print job owner to identify an authenticate himself before
printing can commence, observation of print job related data by casual users is
prevented.
T.MALWARE
The threat is met by the following objectives for the environment:
O.F.INBOUND_FILTER - The TOE will only support TCP/IP as a network
protocol. D.INBOUND_TRAFFIC shall only enter the TOE (R.ENTER_TOE) if
the Port is specified as being open.
The chances of mal-ware being accidentally sent to the TOE and causing a security
violation is limited by only opening the ports and enabling the protocols that are
absolutely necessary for the operation of the TOE.
O.F.OUTBOUND_FILTER - The TOE will only support TCP/IP as a network
protocol. D.OUTBOUND_TRAFFIC shall only exit the TOE (R.EXIT_TOE) if its
Port is specified as being open.
Although the TOE is designed, tested and configured with security as a main
concern, it is possible that vulnerabilities will be discovered in the future that could
be exploited in order to use the TOE as a launch pad for an attack. By only opening
the ports and enabling the protocols that are absolutely necessary for the operation
of the TOE, the chances of a successful attack launch are limited.
Although policy states that a Digital Copier from Oce will be used, the Digital
Copier is an un-trusted device. The chances of an attack on the LAN being
mounted via the Digital Copier interface are reduced by the TOE filtering the
outbound traffic so that only ports that are absolutely necessary for the operation of
the TOE are open.
O.F.SELFTEST – The TOE will perform check of the integrity of the TSF when it
is re-booted.
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 45 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
During start-up, the TOE checks to see if any of the TSF relevant files on the hard
disk have been modified. This can happen due to a malware attack but occurs more
often as a result of a power outage. Maintaining the integrity of the TOE gives
assurance in support of the claim that the TOE will not form a threat against it
operational environment.
P.JOB_DELETE
The policy requirement is met by the following TOE functional objective:
O.F.JOB_SHRED - The TOE shall delete all D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB,
D.PRINT_JOB and D.SCAN_JOB data as soon as it is no longer required or
during the start-up procedure if residual D.SECURE_PRINT_JOB, D.PRINT_JOB
and D.SCAN_JOB is found on the TOE’s hard disk. The first write cycle will
either immediately after the job has completed or once the TOE enters an idle state.
The data shall be deleted according to a recognised standard so that it cannot be
reconstituted.
‘Scrubbing’ the data from the hard disk when it is not longer needed helps prevent
the data been accessed by unauthorised persons.
P.TOE_ADMINISTRATION
The policy requirement is met by the following TOE functional objective:
O.F.AUTHENTICATE - The TOE ensures that S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER must identify and authenticate themselves to the TOE
before allowing them to modify the TOE security settings.

The purpose of the Security Requirements Rationale is to demonstrate that the
security requirements are suitable to meet the Security Objectives.

O.F.SELFTEST X X X
The individual rationales demonstrating the objectives are met are described as
follows:
O.F.INBOUND_FILTER
FDP_ACC.1 Subset access control
Inbound traffic is filtered so that only traffic relating to the operation of the TOE is
allowed to enter the TOE. This SFR supports the security objective by restricting
the TOE data flow to only that that is necessary for the operation of the TOE. This
reduces the number of vulnerable entry points.
FDP_ACF.1 Security attribute based access control
All ports that are not necessary for the operation of the TOE as described in this
document are blocked. This SFR supports the security objective by reducing the
number of entry points that could be vulnerable to attack.
FMT_MSA.1 Management of security attributes
The TOE is delivered pre-configured to the customer. This SFR supports the
objective by ensuring that it is not possible for any user (including
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER and S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN) to change the settings of
the firewall mechanism.
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 47 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
FMT_MSA.3 Static Attribute initialisation
In order to change the security attributes of the TOE the management interfaces
provided for S.SERVICE_ENGINEER and S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN must be
used. This SFR supports the objective by ensuring that the TOE provides restrictive
default security related settings that require no additional modification by
SERVICE_ENGINEER or S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN. Nobody is allowed to create
new settings with alternative values.
FPT_SEP.1 TSF domain separation
Filtering of network traffic occurs is an area of the TOE that is separate to non-TSF
related operation. This SFR supports the objective by ensuring that the filtering
mechanism is protected by it not being exposed to non TSF mechanisms from
which a possible attack could be made.
FPT_RVM.1 Non-bypassability of the TSP
In order for data to enter or leave the TOE it must pass through the filtering
mechanism. This SFR supports the security objective by ensuring that TSF cannot
be bypassed, resulting in a direct line between the Digital Copier and the network
to which the TOE is attached being created.
O.F.OUTBOUND_FILTER
FDP_ACC.1 Subset access control
Outbound traffic is filtered so that only traffic relating to the operation of the TOE
is allowed to leave the TOE. This SFR supports the security objective by restricting
the TOE data flow to only that that is necessary for the operation of the TOE.
FDP_ACF.1 Security attribute based access control
All ports that are not necessary for the operation of the TOE as described in this
document are blocked. This SFR supports the security objective by reducing the
number of exit points through which an attack could be launched.
FMT_MSA.1 Management of security attributes
The TOE is delivered pre-configured to the customer. This SFR supports the
objective by ensuring that it is not possible for any user (including
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER and S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN) to change the settings of
the firewall mechanism.
FMT_MSA.3 Static Attribute initialisation
In order to change the security attributes of the TOE the management interfaces
provided for S.SERVICE_ENGINEER and S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN must be
used. This SFR supports the objective by ensuring that the TOE provides restrictive
default security related settings that require no additional modification by
SERVICE_ENGINEER or S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN. Nobody is allowed to create
new settings with alternative values.

FPT_RVM.1 Non-bypassability of the TSP
In order for data to enter or leave the TOE it must pass through the filtering
mechanism. This SFR supports the security objective by ensuring that TSF cannot
be bypassed, resulting in a direct line between the Digital Copier and the network
to which the TOE is attached being created.
FPT_SEP.1 TSF domain separation
Filtering of network traffic occurs is an area of the TOE that is separate to non-TSF
related operation. This SFR supports the objective by ensuring that the filtering
mechanism is protected by it not being exposed to other non-TSF mechanisms
from which a possible attack could be made.
O.F.JOB_RELEASE
FIA_UID.1 Timing of identification (Secure Printing)
Printing will only commence once the TSF has validated the Username associated
with the job by S.LOCAL_USER. The TSF receives the Username via the
DAC/DC interface. This SFR supports the security objective by requiring the
S.LOCAL_USER to identify himself as part of the job release process.
FIA_UAU.1 Timing of authentication
Printing will only commence once the TSF has validated the PIN associated with
the job by S.LOCAL_USER. The TSF receives the PIN via the DAC/DC interface.
This SFR supports the security objective by requiring the S.LOCAL_USER to
authenticate himself as part of the job release process.
FPT_RVM.1 Non-bypassability of the TSP
Print jobs cannot be processed by any other mechanism than by the specified
mechanism. This SFR supports the objective by ensuring that no other mechanisms
can access the print job data.
FPT_SEP.1 TSF domain separation
Management of print jobs occurs in an area of the TOE that is separate to non-TSF
related operation. This SFR supports the objective by ensuring that the job release
mechanism is protected by it not being exposed to other non-TSF mechanisms
from which a possible attack could be made.
O.F.JOB_SHRED
FDP_RIP.1 Subset residual; information protection
This SFR supports the objective by ensuring that once a print or scan job has
completed, or if during the startup procedure, residual print or scan job data is
found then the related data will be electronically shredded from the hard disk. The
SFR has been refined to describe the moment when the data will be shredded.
FPT_RVM.1 Non-bypassability of the TSP
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 49 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
Print and scan jobs must pass through the shredding mechanism. This SFR
supports the objective by ensuring that print and scan jobs cannot leave the TOE
except in the authorised manner.
FPT_SEP.1 TSF domain separation
Shredding occurs is an area of the TOE that is separate to non-TSF related
operation. This SFR supports the objective by ensuring that the shredding
mechanism is protected by it not being exposed to other non TSF-mechanisms
from which a possible attack could be made.
O.F.AUTHENTICATE
FIA_UID.2 User identification before any action
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and S.SERVICE_ENGINEER must identify themselves
to the TOE before any TOE management actions can be performed.
FIA_UAU.2 User authentication before any action
S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and S.SERVICE_ENGINEER must authenticate
themselves to the TOE before any TOE management actions can be performed.
FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions
The functions that can be performed by either the S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER are defined.
FMT_MOF.1 Management of security functions behaviour
Only TOE administrators and Océ technicians can use security related functions.
FMT_SMR.1 Security roles
The TOE shall make a distinction between administrators and ordinary users.
FPT_RVM.1 Non-bypassability of the TSP
Users other than S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and S.SERVICE_ENGINEER cannot
gain access to security management functions of the TOE without begin first
controlled by the mechanisms specified in this document.
FPT_SEP.1 TSF domain separation
Identification and authentication of users occurs in an area of the TOE that is
separate to non-security related operation.
O.F.SELFTTEST
FPT_TST.1 TSF Testing
When the TOE is started up, it will perform a suite of self tests and determine that
it is working correctly. If it determines that there is a problem it will try to repair
itself. If this fails it will place itself in an ‘out-of order’ mode

The self-test mechanism cannot be by passed.
FPT_SEP.1 TSF domain separation
Self-testing of the TOE occurs in an area of the TOE that is separate to non-TSF
related operation.
8.2.2 The security requirements for the IT environment meet the security
objectives for the environment
The TOE does not make any security requirements on its environment.
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 51 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
8.2.3 The Assurance Requirements and Strength of Function Claim are
appropriate
The Assurance Requirements consist of EAL 2 requirements components. The
TOE is a commercially available device produced by a well-known manufacturer
and most importantly, provides a limited set of security related functionality. The
TOE has been structurally tested by Océ and is suitable for environments that
require a low to moderate level of independently assured security. The developer
works in a consistent manner with good commercial practice.
Occasionally the TOE may develop a problem that requires
S.SERVICE_ENGINEER to make a visit to the customer location in order to repair
the TOE. Océ has procedures that support these processes and for this reason the
assurance requirements have been augmented with the following assurance classes
as the developer is able to meet them:
Components for Life cycle support (Class ALC)
• ALC_FLR.1 Basic Flaw Remediation
The evaluation of the TOE security mechanisms at AVA_VLA.1 is designed to
provide assurance against an attacker with a low attack potential. Therefore the
SOF claim is SOF-basic. This strength of function claim is consistent with the
security objectives for the TOE and the defined TOE assumptions that have been
made.
8.2.4 All dependencies have been met
The following dependencies are identified: FDP_ACF.1, FDP_ACC.1,
FMT_MSA.1, FMT_MSA.3, FIA_UID.1, FMT_SMF.1, FMT_SMR.1,
FPT_AMT.1.
EAL2+ ALC_FLR
Which comprises of:
ACM_CAP.2 Configuration Items
ADO_DEL.1 Delivery procedures
ADO_IGS.1 Installation, generation, and start-up procedures
ADV_FSP.1 Fully defined external interfaces
ADV_HLD.1 Security enforcing high-level design
ADV_RCR.1 Informal correspondence demonstration

O.A.SLA
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 52 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
The dependency FPT_AMT.1 Abstract machine is not included, because the
underlying IT platform does not contribute to the TOE requirements (See part 1,
paragraph 147). The underlying IT platform is a standard embedded PC platform
that works. Testing of the platform does not provide assurance that will support the
claims at the level of EAL2, as functional testing of the DAC in its operational
environment is performed (it does what is should do).
All other dependencies are met.
8.2.5 The requirements are internally consistent
Because the assurance requirements form a package (EAL 2) they are internally
consistent. The addition of ALC_FLR.1 does not cause inconsistencies with the
EAL 2 package.
The functional requirements and assurance requirements do not have any
dependencies between them, and are therefore completely independent of each
other. Because both functional and assurance requirements are internally
consistent, and they are independent, the requirements are internally consistent.
8.2.6 The requirements are mutually supportive
The requirements are complete and do not cause inconsistencies, therefore the
requirements are considered to be mutually supportive. (This argument has been
based on section 9.3.8 of Guide for the production of PPs and STs, PDTR 15446
N2449)

FDP_ACC.1
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that only traffic is allowed to enter
the TOE that is relevant to its operation. This SFR is supported by SF.FILTERING
that restricts flow of network traffic and limits the supported network protocols.
FDP_ACF.1
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that all ports that are non-essential
to the operation of the TOE are blocked. This SFR is supported by
SF.FILTERING. SF.FILTERING expands on the restricted flow of network traffic
and supported network protocols by defining which ports are open and which
protocols are supported.
FIA_UID.1
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that the TSF verifies the identity of
S.LOCAL_USER before allowing SF.JOB_RELEASE. This helps to ensure that
access to confidential print jobs is restricted.
FIA.UAU.1
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that the TSF authenticates
S.LOCAL_USER by correctly supplying the PIN associated with the secure print
job before SF.JOB_RELEASE will commence. This helps to ensure that access to
confidential print jobs is restricted.
FDP_RIP.1
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 54 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
This Security Functional Requirement ensures requires that residual information
relating to D.SECURE_PRINTJOB, D.PRINTJOB and D.SCANJOB is deleted
once they are no longer needed, or, if during the startup procedure residual print or
scan job data is found on the hard disk. The SFR has been refined to describe the
moment when the data will be shredded. This SFR is supported by
SF.SHREDDING that provides functionality that ensures the data objects detailed
above are shredded in accordance with known standards. This SFR helps to reduce
the amount of sensitive data present on the hard disk in the event of it being stolen.
FIA_UID.2
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that administrators correctly identify
themselves to the TOE before security management functions can be used. This
SFR is supported by SF.MANAGEMENT and provides functionality whereby
administrators (S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and S.SERVICE_ENGINEER) can
identify themselves to the TOE. This helps to restrict access to security
management functions and thereby reduces the risk of modification being made to
the TOE settings by unauthorised users.
FIA_UAU.2
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that administrators correctly
authenticate themselves to the TOE before security management functions can be
used. This SFR is supported by SF.MANAGEMENT and provides functionality
whereby administrators (S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN and S.SERVICE_ENGINEER)
can authenticate themselves to the TOE. This helps to restrict access to security
management functions and thereby reduces the risk of modification being made to
the TOE settings by unauthorised users.
FMT_MOF.1
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that the TOE management functions
are only used by either the Océ technician (S.SERVICE_ENGINEER) or customer
system administrator (S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN). This SFR is supported by
SF.MANAGEMENT and ensures that non-administrators cannot administer the
TOE.
FMT_MSA.1
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that the TOE management functions
related to the filter mechanism settings cannot be changed. This SFR is supported
by SF.MANGEMENT that ensures that filter related settings cannot be changed by
administrators.
FMT_MSA.3
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that the TOE management functions
related to the filter mechanism settings are given default values. This SFR is
supported by SF.MANAGEMENT that ensures that the filter related settings are
pre-configured before delivery to the customer.

This Security Functional Requirement ensures that the TOE management functions
are defined. This SFR is supported by functions made available by
SF.MANAGEMENT and defines the set of operations that are available to the Océ
technician (S.SERVICE_ENGINEER) or customer system administrator
(S.REMOTE_SYSADMIN) that are needed to administrate the TOE.
FMT_SMR.1
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that the TOE makes a distinction
between security related roles and normal users. This SFR is supported by
SF.MANAGEMENT. This SFR is supported by SF.MANAGEMENT and ensures
that non-administrators cannot administer the TOE.

This Security Functional Requirement ensures that the TSF operates in its own
domain and cannot be influenced by external sources. This requirement is met by
the physical characteristics of the TOE that comprises software that uses a generic
PC hardware platform. The DAC only provides functionality related to the
operation of the TOE and does not have dual function, for example, as an office
file server. The nature of the TOE is such that evaluation at EAL2 provides a
suitable level of assurance that the TSF operates in it’s own domain.
The operation of the TSF in its own domain provides the following:
1. The filtering mechanisms are in a separate domain to the rest of the non-
security related operations that the TOE performs. This SFR is supported
by SF.FILTERING. This protects the integrity of the filtering mechanism
against un-authorised subjects and threat attacks.
2. The print job management mechanisms are in a separate domain to the
rest of the non-security related operations that the TOE performs. This
SFR is supported by SF.JOB_RELEASE This protects the integrity of the
print job mechanism against un-authorised subjects and threat attacks.
3. The shredding mechanisms are in a separate domain to the rest of the non-
security related operations that the TOE performs. This SFR is supported
by SF.SHREDDING. This protects the integrity of the shredding
mechanism against un-authorised subjects and threat attacks.
4. The TOE security management mechanisms are in a separate domain to
the rest of the non-security related operations that the TOE performs. This
SFR is supported by SF.MANAGEMENT. This protects the integrity of
the security management mechanisms against un-authorised subjects and
threat attacks.
5. The TOE start-up check mechanisms are in a separate domain to the rest
of the non-security related operations that the TOE performs. This SFR is
supported by SF. SELFTEST. This protects the integrity of the start-up
check mechanisms against un-authorised subjects and threat attacks.

FPT_RVM.1
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that no security related operations
can be performed without being controlled by the TOE’s security mechanisms. The
DAC provides a limited set of security functionality that is related to the operation
of the TOE. The nature of the TOE is such that evaluation at EAL2 provides a
suitable level of assurance that the only the TSF can perform security related
operations.
This SFR is supported by SF.MANAGEMENT.
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that:
1. No filtering mechanisms can be performed without being controlled by
the TOE’s security mechanisms. This SFR is supported by
SF.FILTERING.
2. No secure print job management mechanisms can be performed without
being controlled by the TOE’s security mechanisms. This SFR is
supported by SF.JOB_RELEASE.
3. No shredding mechanisms can be performed without being controlled by
the TOE’s security mechanisms. This SFR is supported by
SF.SHREDDING.
4. No security related operations can be performed without being controlled
by the TOE’s security mechanisms. This SFR is supported by
SF.MANAGEMENT.
5. The TOE start-up check mechanisms are in a separate domain to the rest
of the non-security related operations that the TOE performs. This SFR is
supported by SF. SELFTEST. This ensures that no security management
mechanisms can be used by un-authorised subjects.
FPT_TST.1
This Security Functional Requirement ensures that the TOE to performs a self-test
during start up. This SFR is supported by SF.SELFTEST. The self-test helps
protect the TOE against T.MALWARE so that it does not become a possible threat
agent against S.NETWORK_DEVICE.
8.3.2 The assurance measures meet the SARs
The statement of assurance measures has been presented in the form of a reference
to the documents that show that the assurance measures have been met (CC Part 3
paragraph 188). This statement can be found in section 6.2.
8.3.3 The SOF-claims for functions meet the SOF-claims for the SFRs
The SFRs FIA_UAU.1, FIA_UAU.2, FIA_UID.1 and FIA_UID.2 require the TOE
to provide security functions that provide identification/authentication functionality
that meets a SOF claim of ‘SOF basic’.
ST-Océ DAC R9.1.6-2.4 57 of 63
25th August 2006 BSI-DSZ-CC- 0370
This rational for this is that the claim must adequate to defend against the identified
threats to the TOE that are identified in the TOE Security Environment for which a
low attack potential exists
The Security Functions that are realised by probabilistic or permutational
mechanisms are:
• SF.JOB_RELEASE
• SF.MANAGEMENT
The claim for these two Security Functions is ‘SOF basic’. These Security
Functions are traced back to the TOE SFRs they implement in 8.3.1
As the SOF claims for the three Security Functions are equal to the SOF claims for
the TOE SFRs they implement, the SOF claims are consistent.
8.3.4 The functions are mutually supportive
The requirements are mutually supportive (see section 8.2.6) and the functions that
implement theses requirements are complete (see section 8.3.1). The functions are
mutually supportive. (This argument has been based on section 9.3.8 of Guide for
the production of PPs and STs, PDTR 15446 N2449)
8.4 PP Claims Rationale
This Security Target TOE does not claim conformance to any Protection Profile.
